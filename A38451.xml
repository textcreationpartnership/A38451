            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE vanity and emptineſs of the Creature, and the excellency and ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, the great and eternal Creatour, are like two Chryſtal Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſet one againſt the other, give mutual light and illuſtration. And our knowledge of God being more by negation, than comprehenſion in this life, the worlds blackneſs cannot but become a foil to ſet off his beauty with the more ſhining ſplendour, and orient luſtre. Theſe two firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, God ordinarily inſtills in our firſt converſion, and convinceth us of with ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:62588:3"/>light and evidence, as they carry a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable accent with them, and ſhould leave upon us a more powerful and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent tincture and impreſſion: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch is our dulneſs and ſtupidity in conning theſe our primary and principal leſſons, as we almoſt forget them as ſoon as we have learnt them. For though at our firſt acquaintance and communion with God, before our heads and hands come to be engaged in the world, we are carried out with a vigorous proſecution of the one, and led into an holy contempt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of the baſe ſpoils of the other; yet when once we and it come to grow familiars, the intereſt of Heaven and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt vail and bow the knee to this our beloved darling and favourite. How many ſet out forward and zealous Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the waies of godlineſs, as if they had fully meant to have taken the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven by violence, whoſe zeal and bleſſedneſs is now not to be found; but of ring-leaders, are proved ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:62588:3"/>thrown by hand-fulls before them, they diſcovered themſelves no better than Apes. By venturing to nibble at Satans pleaſurable bait, we are often catched with his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſtroying hook, and by overmuch incumbring our ſelves with the world, we become (the beſt of us) like <hi>Anſelms</hi> bird, which had a ſtone tied to her leg, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her down to earth, as faſt as ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an aſcent to Heaven. This heavy weight ſo beſets us, as we cannot run with patience the race ſet before us. So that beſides our initiation, and firſt indoctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the things that are excellent, God is forced ever and anon to become our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor, and catechize us anew at the ſchool of the Croſs; in his wilderneſs ſpeaking to our heart, and by his word and works, rubbing up our memories afreſh with the meditations of what we firſt imbibed, though now have loſt the ſcent and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of. And it's no other than free grace, and infinite mercy in our heavenly Father to recall his extravagant Prodigals, who will change their Fathers bread for the worlds husks, and thus go out of Gods bleſſing into the warm Sun. Would we indeed make uſe of the ſpectacles of the word, we might plainly read the inſcription of vanity; yea, vanity of vanities, written
<pb facs="tcp:62588:4"/>on the forehead of all creatures; and though never ſo ſhort-ſighted, ſee an end of all created perfection. But alas, commonly we look at the wrong end of the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, or look on the world in a multiplying-glaſs, which repreſents it to our fancy, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, ſome great matter, and on the great God in an extenuating, which makes him appear little in our vain imaginations; and ſo we entertain debaſing thoughts of that eternal verity, while we have high concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe low and ſublunary vanities. And ſeeing theſe ear-remembrances ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice not for our conviction, it's but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and requiſite God ſhould finde out ſome other way of inſtruction for us, wherein both our ear and eye ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an impreſſion: And that they who would not learn by the teachings of the Word, ſhould have the voice of the Rod cry to them, which (though leſs articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late) may yet become more ſignificative. And hath not God been a long time teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by his Providence, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> did once the men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> by briars and thorns, and reading us a large lecture of the uncertainty of all created beings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?

The very mention whereof can be no other than a fire in our bones; and whoever hath the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, cannot but by ſympathy ſuffer, and be offended at ſuch a burning. What Engliſh mans heart ſo ſtony as not to bleed within him, or can his eyes contain from tears, either to have heard or ſeen the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of our Nation, the royal and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent City of the Kingdom, once the wonder of the world, and even mirrour of all Chriſtendom; ſo beautiful for ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, numerous in people, famous for riches, ſtrength, beauty and honour, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with the duſt, ſo as one ſtone's not left on another, and become a burning pile, an heap of rubbiſh, a place of deſolation, even in a moment? <hi>Quis talia fando tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret à lachrymis?</hi> What ear was ever audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ſo awk and direful a knell, as then alarum'd its Inhabitants? What eye ever ſpectator of ſo dreadful and doleful a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy as was then acted on that noble
<pb facs="tcp:62588:5"/>theatre? Who ever ſaw ſo devouring a fire, or heard of ſuch a diſmal flame, ſo ſudden, violent, univerſal, irreſiſtible, and (to be feared) irrepairable? Surely, what terrour and affrightment, what amuſe and amazement, what horrour, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of ſpirit, this rueful ſpectacle ſeized the ſpirits of its beholders withall, is impoſſible to divine and imagine. Poor ſouls, (me-thinks) I ſaw at a diſtance your pale faces, trembling joynts, weakned hands, dedolent hearts, who were in this ſo fatal a blow moſt nearly concerned; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear you crying out to your friends and neighbours, to your Rulers and Governours, as the woman did once to that King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Help, O King,</hi> who were all forced to return you that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer, <hi>If the Lord helps not, whence ſhould we help?</hi> Ah what thouſand pities (had Heaven pleaſed to have prevented) to ſee ſo many famous ſtructures, antient and venerable Monuments, learned Libraries, rich goods and treaſures, beautifull Halls and Exchanges, uſefull Churches and Chappels within ſo ſmall a compaſs, turned into a Chaos of confuſion, and heap of utter deſtruction! Ah how lamentable a ſight to ſee ſo many able Citizens impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſht, ſo many mean ones quite beggar'd!
<pb facs="tcp:62588:5"/>how hideous an out-cry to hear men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, We who had thouſands in the morning, had not a penny left to help us by the evening! we who had full tables, could afford plentiful entertainments, rich purſes, and large banks, enough for back and belly, for neceſſity and delight, for us and ours, are now reduced many of us to a morſel of bread, and glad to live on the alms of the charitable; we went out full, but came in empty. Ah how ſad to behold ſo many families ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, ſo many dwellings and places, that muſt never more know their owners and inmates, but have for ever caſt them out, leaving them to the wide world, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them, as ſo many Tenants at will, and that without any warning, to the mercy of the great and ſoveraign Land-Lord of Heaven and Earth! What true Son of Sion, upon view or tydings of ſo ſad a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, muſt not bear a part in the Churches Funeral Elegy over <hi>Jeruſalem, Lam.</hi> 1.1. <hi>How doth the City ſit ſolitary, that was full of people? How is ſhe become as a Widow? ſhe that was great among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Princeſs among the Provinces?</hi> And ſo <hi>cap.</hi> 4.11. <hi>The Lord hath accompliſht his fury, he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
<pb facs="tcp:62588:6"/>devoured the foundations thereof.</hi> Oh that by the brightneſs of theſe flames we could ſee our ſin, that hath long appeared as at noon day, but we would never yet behold by the Sun-light of the word! And that this moſt formidable fire may become to us a flaming beacon, to ſignifie our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger and ruin, unleſs Gods anger be timely quenched by the blood of Chriſt, and tears of repentance. And that amidſt the cold formalities, and freezing devotions in the winter quarter of theſe laſt and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times, our cooler ſouls might be heated, and our dying affections (by an holy kind of Anteperiſtaſis) advanced into a diviner flame of holy zeal, in ſeeking the Lord, leſt he makes us as <hi>Admah,</hi> and ſets us as <hi>Zeboim,</hi> and kindles a fire in the Palaces of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſo as none ſhall quench it. Oh that we could all learn, from the higheſt to the loweſt, thoſe leſſons, Gods intention is to teach us by ſo ſevere diſpenſations, either for humiliation for what is paſt, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for time to come. And if I miſtake not, the phyſiognomy of this providence (whether it be looked on in the glaſs of a more immediate or more mediate agency) Gods hand appeared moſt remarkably in it, and concurring circumſtances give us plain intimations of its commiſſion, and direction
<pb facs="tcp:62588:6"/>by a ſpecial ſuperintendency from Heaven. And though (like a picture well drawn) it looks wiſhly on every one in the room, yet it ſeems to prefer a particular charge againſt thoſe wickedneſſes of pride, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wantonneſs, ſecurity, earthlineſs, and uncharitableneſs, which have ſo long burnt as fire among us. Ah what haughtineſs, idleneſs, and fulneſs of bread was to be found in our ſtreets? with what pleaſure did we live upon earth? what port and ſtate did we begin to carry? what wantons were we grown, forgetting the God that made us, not attributing to him our power to get wealth, having our hearts lifted up, or like fooliſh children, with <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> ſtanding on our heads, &amp; kicking againſt Heaven, and neglecting the God of our ſalvation, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Gods corn, wine, oyl, wooll and flax, to our luſts and lovers, inſtead of our Creatour! Were we not grown like <hi>Sodom</hi> and the Old World, a God-deſpiſing, and a ſelf-pleaſing people? that gave up our ſelves to eating and drinking, buying and ſelling, planting and building, every man looking to his own way and gain; and as for the ſhip of the Church, the intereſt of God and Religion; having caught the fiſh, we laid aſide the net; and ſo we could but ſave our own petty Cabbins, let Gods and
<pb facs="tcp:62588:7"/>Chriſts cauſe ſink or ſwim, we were become <hi>Gallio's,</hi> not minding theſe things! Oh how did we that pretended to God, mind little or nothing but the world? How went we, one to his farm, another to his merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; our ſhop was become our cloſet, and the Exchange our Church. The Courtier, the Merchant, the Tradeſman, all buſie as ſo many Ants on an Hill to ſcrape together ſo much refined duſt, and lade themſelves with this thick clay: Every one ſetting up his Heaven on Earth, and ſinging a <hi>requiem</hi> to his ſoul in his ſtately houſes, full ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, vaſt incomes, if not unjuſt gains and oppreſſions, looking ſo much to earth, as thoſe that had neither time or mind to look up to Heaven; but if with the Lark, ſoaring to Heaven in pretences of zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Sabbath; with the Worm, groveling on the worlds dung-hill all the week after. Like him in the Poet, (that cried out, <hi>O Coelum,</hi> with his tongue, when his hand toucht the earth) committing even a ſolliciſm with our hands, and bidding an expreſs practical contradiction to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. Ah is it not juſt God, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us the world as a creature, which we could not have, but muſt adore as our God? Is it not righteous, that ſhould be taken out of our hands, which inſtead of
<pb facs="tcp:62588:7"/>being trodden under our feet, had got up ſo near our hearts? Oh how much better Chriſtians, (for to you alone I now ſpeak) (as for the wicked who grow worſe and worſe, and do more wickedly, Hell fire ſhall ſhortly do that in conſuming them, which this could not do for refining) had it been for you to have caſt your bread on the waters, than to have had it waſted by ſuch a fire? Ah, had you but worn the world as a looſe garment, that you might have put off and on at pleaſure, it would not now have come from you (as your skin from your fleſh) with pain and torture, but eaſe and delight; or as the blood out of your veins, with reluctancy and oppoſition, but as water from a fountain, with freedom and liberty. Theſe pictures, if hung up looſly, would have been taken down with leſs rending, tearing, and noiſe, than they are like to be, if your hearts be faſtened or glewed to them. Oh Sirs, had you minded God and Chriſt, as you did this Mammon of the world, and attended your heavenly trade, as you did your Eaſt-India, Turky, French, Spaniſh, or the reſt, and converſed with God in your cloſets, as you did with your cuſtomers in your ſhops, and your friends and neighbours ſometimes at the Tavern, you had had ſomething in ſuch an
<pb facs="tcp:62588:8"/>hour to bear up and comfort your ſpirits withall, which I am afraid, many of you now want. Oh that you would in this your day, yet know the things of your peace! And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God riſeth up to Judgement a ſecond time, and the fire of his wrath now ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, breaks out with a ſeven times more, even into a moſt violent and unquenchable flame; Hear the voice of the Rod, and him that hath appointed it: And by all that God hath done, or is doing with you this day, learn thoſe fundamental leſſons, of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and contingency of the creature, and the fulneſs and alſufficiency of the Creator; ſo as to make an utter renunciation of all carnal confidence, and engage your ſouls in a firm and reſolute dependance on God alone. O that this might indeed be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory fire, to refine our ſouls from all that ruſt of carnality, and worldly affection that is ſo grown upon us! Let us not make gain our godlineſs, but count godlineſs our greateſt and only gain. Why ſhould we ſet our hearts on vanity, on a non entity? who would love or value that which he cannot long keep, but if a fire or plunder comes, is upon the wing, and takes its flight; or give that the chair of ſtate, or upper room of preheminence in his heart, which very ſhortly he muſt part with out
<pb facs="tcp:62588:8"/>of his hands? Can you (Chriſtians) carry your houſes and lands, your baggs and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with you to eternity? will they not all ſhake hands with you at the grave? O then make friends (by employing for God and his honour) to your ſelves of this Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of unrighteouſneſs, and uſe the world as if ye uſed it not, remembring the faſhion thereof paſſeth away: And lay up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures not on earth, but Heaven; ſtore up a good foundation againſt the time to come, the top of whoſe building may reach eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Mind not ſo much things ſeen and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as thoſe believed and eternal. Make ſure of God as your portion, and chuſe him as your inheritance. Now learn to truſt to, and lean by faith on the arm of an Alſufficient God, while ye experience the broken ſtaff of all created beings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. When the ſtream is dried up, and all your veſſels emptied, have recourſe to that inexhauſtible fountain. Learn the Art of living by faith upon an unchangeable and eternal <hi>Jehovah</hi> under all worldly changes and revolutions: To rejoyce in the Lord, and be glad in the God of your ſalvation, not only when ye ſit under the ſhadow of your own Vines and Fig-trees, but even when they neither bloſſom, nor bring forth fruit. Though your goods be gone, yet ye have not loſt your God; he is not gone,
<pb facs="tcp:62588:9"/>whoſe alſufficiency is able to make up all your loſſes by plague or fire, and recompence you an hundred-fold, in whom alone (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things) you may poſſeſs them, while you have nothing. Though your trade be at preſent broken, ye have now a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gale for Heavens more enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Though ye may be diſperſed and ſcattered as Vagabonds here and there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no certain dwelling-place, God will be a little ſanctuary to you; and though your City hath forſaken ye, your God is a Tower yet left, which your ſouls may get upon, and a City of Refuge for you to fly to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in with greateſt ſecurity. Though ye have nothing but tents to dwell in, and (with holy <hi>Jacob</hi>) a ſtone for a pillow to lay your head on, God is in this place, and he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſlumbers nor ſleeps, watcheth for your ſafety, while his Angels alſo are your life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and protection: He is your arm every morning, and your ſalvation in time of trouble. Though all die and leave you, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, poſſeſſions, yet your God lives, who is ten thouſand times better, and able to make it better to you than all the goods and eſtates in the world. Truſt in the Lord then for ever, in the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in whom is everlaſting ſtrength. And then, ſhould you fall into the hand of mens violence out of that of Gods vengeance, while the enemies of <hi>Jacob</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:62588:9"/>your hunters, you are ſure of the God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> for your help. This conſideration was that holy <hi>David</hi> bore up his reeling ſoul withall under all the reflections of the wickeds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and enmity; <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? my fleſh and heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> And in all the weights of his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, he incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God. And this was the infallible pillar and foundation with which the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all her ruins, ſupported her drooping faith, even the eternity of God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Thou, O Lord, remaineſt for ever, thy Throne from generation to generation.</hi> And Reader, it's the hearty option of my ſoul, that thou, and all that read theſe lines, yea all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe fatal ſtrokes from the King on the throne, to the beggar on the dung-hill, had the ſame comfort under <hi>Londons</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that holy <hi>David</hi> had once on <hi>Ziglags;</hi> even a God to incourage themſelves in, who is, what, and where he was, the ſame God to his for ever and ever, when all perſons, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and creatures, ſhall not be what they once were, or be no more. This incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all them who fear the Lord, is the ſole deſign of this enſuing diſcourſe. The Author intending it no other than an anchor to buoy up our finking ſpirits, or crutch, the better to inable to ſtep our limping faith. <hi>A
<pb facs="tcp:62588:10"/>word in ſeaſon, is as apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</hi> And he hopes (if you have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgotten the hand of God upon you) he might find ſome advantage in this preſent addreſs, our hearts under afflictions being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies more pliable, and apt to receive divine ſignatures and impreſſions. In this your help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and almoſt hopeleſs ſtate the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſeemed to call to him, as once the men of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, come over and help us. And though a ſtranger to moſt of your faces, yet being a fellow-ſufferer with you through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpirit of Chriſtianity, his bowels could not but be inlarged with pity, and his heart inflamed with zeal and piety towards you: And (ſeeing no other ſtept before him) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on himſelf as obliged to open to you ſome door of hope in this valley of diſcomfort, and afford you what after-help his poor talent could, to bear your preſent condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to you a plank after ſhipwrack, to bring your ſouls to a comfortable ſhore.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Appineſs is a bleſſed word, bigg-bellied with comfort, and full fraught with ſatisfaction; as full of ſweetneſs, as the Breaſt of Milk, the Cane of Sugar, or Comb of Honey; as grateful and refreſhing to the reaſonable ſoul of man, and much more the awakened and enlightened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Chriſtian as the fountain is with its water to the thirſty Traveller, or the Sun with its light to the greedy beholder. Felicity is the grand attractive of every appetite, and the common
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62588:17"/>loadſtone of all the deſires of the Sons of men. Its <hi>generale votum, univerſalis ſupplicatio,</hi> the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vote, and univerſal requeſt of all mankind. <hi>Who will ſhew us any good,</hi> is language naturally ſpoken, and almoſt worn thread-bare by the mouths of all men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. Whatſoever other difference runs in the current of humane opinions, their affections herein are all tuned uniſons, and their muſick is in conſort. As conformity to God in holineſs, is the moſt perfect intendment, ſo in happineſs, is the moſt deſirable attainment of men and Angels? Who is it that would not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? or though they affect no good in them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not good to them? Though few but diſdain holineſs in the way, all deſign happineſs in the end. Even the Heathens themſelves affected, as well as conceived, a Fools Paradiſe, a Phanatick Elyſium of bliſs and happineſs, as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians a real. They entertained multiplied opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about happineſs, ſome placing it in gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, others of fortune (by them ſo called) a third ſort, of mind: Some in pleaſure, ſome in profits and honours, others in learning, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or acquired endowments; all in ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal good, and outward ſatisfaction. They brake the ſhell, and we gat the kernel; they ran away with the notion and bare ſpeculation, we are bleſſed with its actual fruition. For having otherwiſe learned Chriſt, we know and believe, This to be eternal life only, to know God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that true happineſs is bound up in God alone, the firſt cauſe, and laſt and utmoſt end, the higheſt and chiefeſt good; ſo tunes that heavenly Choriſter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. after a deſcant

            <p>In which words are obſervable two general parts:</p>
            <p>Firſt, A general and indefinite Propoſition, of comfort, <hi>Happy is he that hath Jacob's God for his help;</hi> whoever he be, he is really bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A more particular Expoſition and Illuſtration; or (if you will) a tacite impoſition of duty, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God. In the former, the comfortable Propoſition, we have ſomething implyed, and ſomething expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Two things are ſuppoſed, and (being coucht in the bowels of the words) deducible thence by way of Illation or Inference. Firſt, A famous and ſignificant deſcription of God, the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Secondly, A tacite aſſertion of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of his power and providence over, or his mercy and goodneſs towards his people. <hi>Their Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A deſcription of God, and that firſt in reſpect of his nature, or the verity and reality of his being and exiſtence, He is ſtyled here by way
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62588:20"/>of elegancy or emphaſis, <hi>the God of Jacob.</hi> Saith <hi>Mollerus,</hi> to diſcern and diſtinguiſh the true God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all Heatheniſh Deities, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode all fictitious gods and worſhips thereunto. As the true God is the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> is the only true God. He is God alone, and there is no other beſides him. The gods of the Heathen are all vanity, they have eyes, and ſee not, ears, and hear not, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.5, 6. But our God is in the Heavens, and doth whatſoever he pleaſeth. He alone is he, whom all mercy and good muſt be expected from, and ſo all prayer and ſupplication directed to. To whom ſhould a people ſeek, but unto their God? his prerogative it is to hear prayers, and <hi>to him ſhall all fleſh come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Title or Appellation ſerves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſcribe him in his ſpecial relation to his people. We finde him called by our Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.5. <hi>The Mighty God of Jacob.</hi> He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the God of the whole Earth, but in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner the God of <hi>Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 15.31.

And as in a ſpecial way he hath made himſelf known to his people; ſo he bears a ſingular reſpect to them, and takes a particular care of them. It's obſervable in Scripture, that he ſtiles not himſelf ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in his revelations of himſelf to them) <hi>the

We finde the Apoſtle drawing up this Concluſion of Faith from the Promiſe; Heb. 13.6. <hi>So that we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my Helper.</hi> He ſupplyes all their ſpiritual wants by influence of the Promiſes, and all their temporal by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Providence. Godlineſs hath the Promiſe, both of this and the next life. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs,</hi> the Apoſtle hath it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. He gives both Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; gives pardon of ſin, peace of Conſcience, ſenſe of his love, and aſſurance of his favour; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, a new heart, and a right ſpirit; holineſs both habitual and actual, in the root and bloſſom. Grace, peace, comfort, quickning, ſtrength, eſtabliſhment, perfection are all his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, freely beſtowed, and gifts abundantly multiplyed on the heads and hearts of his people through Jeſus Chriſt.

He ſends light to them which are in darkneſs, life to them which labour under dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, liberty to them which are captive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by ſin and Satan. He cloaths the naked ſoul with the honourable robe of juſtification, and enriches the poor Conſcience with the fine Gold of Sanctification.

Neither doth he give them only the upper, but as <hi>Caleb</hi> did his Daughter, alſo the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Springs. As he gives them a double portion, a <hi>Benjamins</hi> Meſs in ſpiritual bleſſings, ſo he is no Niggard to them in temporal conveniencies and accommodations; but while he gives them himſelf for their portion, he gives them theſe for their paſſage. He hath entayled by way of Covenant on them, the Corn, Wine, and Oyl; anoynts their ſteps with Butter and Honey, feeds them with the fineſt of the Wheat, and lets them drink the pureſt blood of the Grape, yea ſatisfies them as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62588:24"/>with Honey out of the rock. He ſpreads their Tables out of his fulneſs, and overflows their Cups with his goodneſs, and allows them not only for neceſſity, but alſo for delight and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> of old with pureſt ſtrains of eloquence deſcribes his depaſture of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 32.13, 14. His have from him all things plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to enjoy, and alwayes <hi>ad ſanitatem,</hi> though not <hi>ad voluntatem;</hi> a competency to ſuſtain their natures, though not a ſuperfluity to maintain their luſts, and pamper their more ſenſual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Lions of the World may ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but Gods Lambs ſhall want no good thing; inſomuch that <hi>David</hi> dare give it forth for an experience and undoubted Obſervation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25. <hi>I never ſaw the righteous forſaken, nor their ſeed begging bread.</hi> The mercies of the Throne are theirs, and no leſs thoſe of the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, the benedictions of Gods heart, and eke of his hand, their portion. And if God condeſcends ſo low as to feed the Ravens and cloath the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Field, how much more will this great <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> of Heaven and Earth take care of his own Family? If he be the Saviour of all men, much more of them that believe. And having right in the promiſe of ſuperadding all things to them while ſeekers of the Kingdom of Heaven, how ſhall they be denyed poſſeſſion? yea ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given them Chriſt and himſelf, how ſhall he forbear to give them all things? For all is theirs, ſeeing they are his; and they may cry out with holy <hi>Athanaſius, Deus meus &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> our God, and our all. Though having nothing, they poſſeſs all things, ſeeing they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62588:24"/>him who poſſeſſeth all things. Such is Gods ſingular care and providence over them, that he bleſſeth their <hi>modicum,</hi> while he curſeth the worldlings abundance; and, while extravagant man diminiſheth, and makes a little of much, the omniprovident God multiplies, and makes much of his peoples little; as appears in <hi>Jacobs</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous acknowledgement, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 33.11. of Gods raiſing him even from a ſtaff and a Scrip, a men, low, and beggerly conditi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, ſo as it ſerves their journey through the Wilderneſs of this World, as he did <hi>Iſraels</hi> in the Deſart, whoſe Cloaths waxed not old on their backs, nor their Shooes on their feet. Nay, when reduced to greateſt ſtraits, ſo as there ſeems no way of eſcape from periſhing rather than want relief, he will work a miracle; of which kind of operation we have many remarkable inſtances upon Record, both in ſacred and civil ſtory; but theſe two may content us to evidence its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; even the multiplication of the Widows Oyl to ſo ſtrange a meaſure, as to ſerve not only for the maint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nance of her Family, but alſo the payment of her debts, and ſatisfaction of all her Creditors, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.7. and the incredible and miraculous increaſe of an handfull of Meal, and a little Oyl in a Cruſe, beyond their natural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſo as to become a ſufficient ſtore under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years famine, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.14. In famine, God redeems his people from death, and when all other Proviſions fail, he can rain down upon their Tents Bread from Heaven, as he did on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62588:25"/>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no leſs than forty years together. That's the firſt, God helps his people by ſupplying their wants and neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An help imports defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt enemies and aſſailants. Thus a man who becomes a ſecond to another, foiled and worſted by reaſon of his impotency and infirmity, one that ſtands by another againſt his adverſary, to defend his right and cauſe, an Advocate that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſuit of his Client; a Prince that relieves his oppreſſed ſubjects; auxiliary forces that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit afreſh a beſieged City, or beaten Army, may be ſtiled helpers to them. And ſuch is God to his choſen. He that is the great <hi>Atlas,</hi> who bears up the Pillars of the Earth, upholds them under all the cruſhings of humane violence, he keepeth the feet of his Saints that they are not moved, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. This <hi>Moſes</hi> moſt lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in that rapſodical benediction of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael: who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is the ſword of thy excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!</hi> a ſword for aſſault, a ſhield and buckler for defence. <hi>Solomon</hi> takes it as an anſwer of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer, even while he is preferring it, That God will maintain the cauſe of his people at all times, as the matter ſhall require, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.59. Upon this account we finde <hi>David</hi> in this Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> oft ſolliciting God for help, urging him to preſerve, ſave, defend, and deliver him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70.1, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.26, &amp;c. And as praying, ſo praiſing him for his help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13. <hi>Thou haſt thruſt ſore at me that I might fall; but the Lord helped me. Saul</hi> and his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62588:25"/>Courtiers bore againſt him, but God was a ſure ſtud and pillar to his ſoul, that ſhored him up, and underpropt him againſt all their rage and malice. Upon this account it is that we finde help and refuge in a conjunction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a preſent help in trouble.</hi> And in this ſenſe God is his peoples help upon a more publick, and alſo a more private account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is the help of his Church in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and that two manner of waies. He helps them firſt immediately, without the intervention of ſecond cauſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26. <hi>There is none like unto the God of Jeſurun, who rideth upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thy help; and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy Refuge, and underneath are the everlaſting Arms; and he ſhall thruſt out the enemy from before thee, and ſhall ſay, Deſtroy them.</hi> God ſometimes goes on foot in the uſe of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and way of means, for the ſalvation of his people; but here he comes riding (as it were) on horſe-back in a more ſudden and immediate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, leaping over the Hills, and skipping over the Mountains. Sometimes he works deliverance, but ſometimes only commands it. <hi>Thou art our King, O God,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>command thou deliverances for Jacob,</hi> Pſal. 44.4. He unbares his own Arm, he puts on righteouſneſs as a breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and clothes himſelf with zeal as a cloak, and when he ſees that there is no man, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that there is no interceſſor, his Arm brings ſalvation, and his righteouſneſs ſuſtains him;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.5.</note> and the appearances and outgoings of his providence are ſo ſignal and conſpicuous, as <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> the finger of Heaven appears, and every ſpectator
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62588:26"/>muſt ſay, <hi>This is the Lords doing,</hi> Hoſ. 1.7. <hi>I will have mercy on the houſe of Judah, and ſave them by the Lord their God, and will not ſave them by bow, nor by ſword, nor by battel, by horſes, nor by horſe-men.</hi> Gods people many times ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men (more of man than of God is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in it) but often they behold the ſalvation of God. <hi>Stand ſtill,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, which he ſhall ſhew you to day, The Lord ſhall fight for you,</hi> Exod. 14.13, 14. God now was in the van and head of their Army; <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall go before thee:</hi> Sometimes went in the heart or body of it; <hi>The holy One of Iſrael in the midſt of thee:</hi> And ſometimes in the rear; <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward,</hi> Iſa. 58.8. How elegantly doth the Prophet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Gods immediate conduct of them through the red Sea and Wilderneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.12. <hi>Where is he that brought them up out of the Sea with the Shepherd of his flock, that led them by the right hand of Moſes, with his glorious Arm, dividing the water before them, to make himſelf an everlaſting Name?</hi> God can rend the Heavens and come down, and make the Hills tremble, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains flow at his preſence. <hi>The Sea ſaw it, and fled. Jordan was driven back, the Mountains skipped like Rams, and the little Hills like Lambs; the Earth trembled at the preſence of the Lord, at the preſence of the God of Jacob; whoſe voice breaks the Oak of Baſhan, and ſhakes the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi> God can blow on his enemies, and with one ireful frown of his providence, can look them into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as with one ſmile of his countenance look his people into ſalvation. This is the Argument of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62588:26"/>
               <hi>Aſa</hi>'s prayer to God, when that invincible Hoſt of a thouſand thouſand came out againſt him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power.</hi> He can ſave by many, by few; nay, without any at all; with means, without means; yea, againſt means can he bring about his peoples help and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mediately, and ſo he helps either by Angelical miniſtration, or by humane aſſiſtances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irſt, By the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niſtry of Angels. They are all miniſtring ſpirits unto thoſe who are heirs of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Not one ſingle, but all the Angels are the Churches, and every particular members I fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, both their ſervitors and ſaviours. They ſhall bear them up in all their waies.

               </gap>ſtration, though ſecret and inviſible, is moſt certain, and powerful to the Church. They ſerve for her enemies offence, and her own defence. When the four Angels were deſtroying, we finde another protecting, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.2. An Angel helps <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by deſtroying <hi>Senacheriks</hi> Army, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ft for deſtruction to enter. An Angel preſerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22. The Angel of the Lord ſtood in the bottom amongſt the myrtle-trees, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.8. They grow by the rivers ſide, Sea ſhore, or in the valley, and are plants of a low ſtature. When Gods people are at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oweſt; then are they under the moſt High, his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62588:27"/>ſpecial ſafeguard and protection. Gods Angels gave <hi>Jacob</hi> a comfortable meeting, when he was expectant of ſo ſad a greeting from his Brother <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 32. When <hi>Flijah</hi> was in his ſolitude, an Angel of the Lord comes to him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging repaſt and refreſhment, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.5. Satan and his evil Angels may combine the Saints deſtruction, but God and his good Angels take care of their welfare and preſervation. We are oft on a ſudden delivered out of great dangers, not knowing how we came out of them, nor which way deliverance came, which is from no other but their miniſtry over us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the aſſiſtance of men: And ſo God helps, firſt, by direct and proper means, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him to that end. Thus God raiſed up <hi>Iſrael</hi> Saviours, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.27. He gave them <hi>Moſes</hi> for a deliverer, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.35. So <hi>Jepthah, Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Joſhuah, David,</hi> and others. God raiſeth up inſtruments to execute his temporal will and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. When <hi>Tolias</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> with others diſaffected, conſpired againſt it, God raiſed up <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who carried on the work of the Temple againſt all oppoſition. Rather than fail of inſtruments, <hi>Cyrus</hi> is Gods Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, who ſhall perform all his pleaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By improbable means, and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. God puts ſuch a ſpirit of valour into <hi>Davids</hi> breaſt, as he deſtroies monſtrous <hi>Goliah,</hi> and routs the Army of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> He cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, and new-models <hi>Gideons</hi> Army to three hundred men, and by them overthrows a puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Hoſt. He marſhals the ſtars, and makes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62588:27"/>them in their courſes to fight againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi> The walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fall down at the ſound of Ramms horns. The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> run at the noiſe on the top of Mulberry-trees, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.24. Earthen pitchers are the trumpets which alarum the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.</hi> The ſtretching out of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes effectual to divide the waters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.16. A very unlikely means to humane apprehenſion. The Hornet drives out the Nations, and the Plague, which one would have thought ſhould have ruined the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> is made Gods weapon to expel the <hi>Canaanites, Hab.</hi> 3.5. One poor fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip breaks, and ſcatters in pieces an invincible Armado. As the Fly and the Bee may be <hi>Iſraels</hi> correctors, ſo the Gnat <hi>Adrians</hi> deſtroyer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By wicked means (or rather wicked men) God makes uſe of bad men to do his people good. <hi>Judas</hi>'s Treaſon is a poiſon, out of which he makes a ſoveraign Treacle for the ſalvation of the world. <hi>Ehud</hi> a left-handed man becomes a Saviour to <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 3. <hi>Gibeonites</hi> become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable unto his Sanctuary. Troublous times forward the building of his Temple, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. When no other helper could be found for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God ſaves them by the hand of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.27. A traiterous Letter proves the Treaſons diſcoverer and bewrayer. That wicked men intend evilly, God brings about for good to his Church. What the envious Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> meant for his ruin, God ordered for his riſe and advancement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62588:28"/>much of the horſes metal as ſerves to keep him in his pace, and carry him on his journey, and the remainder he bridleth. The wiſe God uſeth mans violence to his own praiſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By contrary and deſtructive means. Clay and Spittle, which (if any thing does) one would think ſhould daub up a mans eyes, and make him that ſees, blind, our Saviour makes uſe of to cauſe the blind man to ſee by. The red Sea, which any one would have imagined ſhould have been the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> grave, became their way and thorow-fare, and by paſſing thorow (which a man would have thought had been the ready way to be drowned) was accompliſht the way of their eſcape and deliverance. The Earth proves the womans midwife, and gives her a ſafe delivery, which in all probability might have ſmothered and ſtifled her conception; and ſwallows up the flood of perſecution, which the Dragon ſpits out of his mouth, which in all likelihood might have ſwallowed her up in a moment, <hi>Ret.</hi> 12.16. The three children ſhone by the light of that flame, by which (as to all humane expectation) they muſt have been burnt and conſumed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. They were indeed ſaved by fire. When Gods people ſeem to run into the mouth of danger, oft times they fall into the lap of deliverance; and while others ſink as a ſtone to the bottom in the waters of affliction, they are born up by the bladders of faith and hope; and as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gloſſes elegantly on <hi>Iſraels</hi> paſſage thorow the vaſt Ocean as a Cauſey, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.14. <hi>They are led thorow the deep as an horſe thorow the wilderneſs, that they ſhould not

            <p>Secondly, To his people in a more particular relation, and private capacity. And that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a threefold regard.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Againſt their own home-bred enemies, the luſts and corruptions of their own perfidious hearts. There is a myſterie of iniquity acting in the treacherous heart of man. The beſt of us carry about us an heart deceitful above all things, even deſperately wicked. Our foes are our own houſhold, <hi>velis nolis intra fines tuos inhabitabit Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ugh places. Many deſperate luſts, as unbelief, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, pride, &amp;c. uſurp Chriſts Throne and Government: But our good God by the help of grace, and his good hand upon us, inables and aſſiſts us againſt their batteries; ſo that though they combate, they ſhall not conquer; and though turbulent, they ſhall not be prevalent. <hi>Conflictus licet miſerabilis, quia non habet pacem, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re rowing againſt the ſtream of corrupt nature. His wind drives againſt that tyde. Grace caſts ſin down, though it cannot caſt it wholly out. Theſe Monarchs have their dominion taken away, though they live for a ſeaſon. Grace helps againſt the power, at well as the guilt of ſin; and though it doth not hinder <hi>ne ſit,</hi> yet <hi>ne obſit,</hi> and while it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62588:29"/>acts the part of a ſlave, or a Tyrant, yet it cannot of a King. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt us, but thou ſhalt do them away,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. And the Prophet ſeconds him, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As againſt the ſtrength of corruption, ſo againſt the onſets and aſſaults of Satan. Thus God aſſiſted <hi>Paul</hi> with a ſufficiency of grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. And Chriſt helped <hi>Peter,</hi> when Satan ſhot a whole broad-ſide of temptations againſt him, he was his bulwark to defend him: when Satan preſſed hard upon him, and beat ſore againſt him, he was his buttreſs to ſupport and uphold him.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Non ignara mali, miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Is engliſhed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Being tempted himſelf, he is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, when the evil Angels were muſtering their forces againſt him, the good Angels came and miniſtred to him; while they were endeavouring to deſtroy him, theſe took care to preſerve and comfort him. In an acceptable time God heard him, and in a day of ſalvation he ſuccoured him. So when his Diſciples are purſued by Satan that mighty Nimrod, and beaten ſore upon by temptations to blaſphemy, deſpair, preſumption, or the like, Chriſt becomes their Sanctuary from the rage and perſecution of that infernal blood-hound, and great deſtroyer of ſouls. When Satan ſtood at the right hand of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62588:29"/>interrupt him in his Office, the Lord Chriſt comes and rebukes him, and tells him, This is a brand pluckt out of the fire, too hot for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to touch and tamper withall, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.2. It's reported of ſome holy men, as <hi>Grynaeus,</hi> and others, that the Devil on their death-beds made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to them, and challenged them to a corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, which they readily entertained, only with premiſe of that promiſe to the diſputation: <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> There is not ſo much venome in the temptation, as there is balſome in the promiſe. If the ſoul be once arked in Chriſts merits, they are to it as ſo many Cities of Refuge; <hi>vulnera Chriſti ſunt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates refugii. Bernard.</hi> This Lion may then roar, but he cannot devour; this Serpent may hiſs, but he cannot ſting; this Dragon ſpit, but he cannot bite nor deſtroy. Upon this ſcore doth the Apoſtle not only give us a commendation of Chriſts ability, pity and fidelity, but alſo a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn invitation to come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace and Mercy, and by our holy and humble Oratory beg help in the time of need. And though it may ſeem ſtrange and improbable, yet Gods people finde it an experimental truth, that they alwaies get ground and advantage, both by corruptions and temptations. Thoſe weeds ſhall not ſpoil the good corn, nor thoſe worms deſtroy the beautiful flowers of grace, though they may be in the field and garden of their ſouls; but the ſight of both ſhall ſerve to humble and quicken them to higher attainments of holineſs. And though Satan ſnarls at, and wrangles with them, he ſhall never trapan them out of their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62588:30"/>right; but being foiled in the diſpute, their cauſe will be the clearer, and worſted in the trial, their evidence the firmer and ſtronger. In all his winnowings, they loſe no one grain of grace, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chaff of corruption.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Againſt, or under all the enmity and oppoſition of the world, ſecret or open; of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friends, or profeſſed enemies; their power, policy, envy, inſolency, treachery, turbulency, rage and fury. Thus God helpt <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that in memory thereof, he baptizeth his child into that very name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The name of the other was Eliezer</hi> (that is, my God is an help) <hi>for the God of my Father, ſaid he, was my help, and delivered me from the ſword of Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But his bow abode in ſtrength, and the arms of his hands were made ſtrong, by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob</hi>—Thus he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to help his <hi>Jacob, Iſa.</hi> 41.10. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits him all ſlaviſh fear, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee by the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Three various expreſſions, to give him manifold aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of divine maintenance under all humane malevolence. Firſt, he promiſes him inward heartning, but if his ſpirits ſhould fail, then he will ſecond him in the conflict; and ſhould he not come off conqueror, yet he ſhall never be overthrown; for at leaſt he will uphold him. Nay, he will not only ſecure him from ſuccum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency, but confer upon him victory; he ſhall not

Yea, under the ſhadow of his divine, or thoſe Cherubims wings of ſpecial protection may they (as the chickens do under the wings of the damm on the Kites approach) hide themſelves ſecurely, till the dint of every calamity be over-paſt. As the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tunes melodiouſly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1. God is to his people both a pillar of cloud, and of fire, one to refocillate and refreſh them, and the other to preſerve and defend them in their journey to Heaven, through the wilderneſs of this world, (as Travellers are by it againſt wild beaſts) Yea, a wall of fire round about them; a wall, to keep in their perſons, and of fire, to keep out their enemies: And in caſe they be yet ſo deſperate as to venture on them, he yet beares them up on Eagles wings, far above out of their reach, or ſight, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.2. His providence is to them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing hedge, ſo that if there be not that <hi>Intus</hi> that muſt deſtroy them (as the voice told <hi>Phocas,</hi> when cloſe barred up in his Maſters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace) they cannot but be ſafe. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro the whole Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe heart is perfect towards him;</hi> and what need they fear ſhipwrack (as that Philoſopher once ſaid, when under fears of drowning, he lookt up to Heaven in a bright ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, and beheld thoſe twinkling luminaries beſpangling and imbroidering that heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy over his head) while they have ſo many
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62588:31"/>eyes of Providence about them. The Keeper of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is always waking, though Enemies be great and mighty, many and numerous, yea neer at hand, they may ſleep ſweetly and comfortably, as <hi>Alexander</hi> once did when in great danger of an approaching adverſary, becauſe <hi>Parmenio,</hi> his chief and vigilant Captain watched: or rather as <hi>David</hi> did when compaſſed about with an Army of ten thouſands at leaſt in imagination, being then alſo hemmed in and incloſed by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.

Whem <hi>Achitophel</hi> had contrived <hi>Davids</hi> ruine, <hi>Huſhai</hi> gives him Intelligence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.16. When <hi>Haman</hi> had conſpired <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s and the <hi>Jews</hi> total extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and fatal deſtruction, God in his wiſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62588:34"/>Providence ſo ordered the Decree about it, as there was upon a Twelve-months ſpace between it and the Execution, ſo as reſpite was given for flight and evaſion, and alſo for application to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King for its Reverſion; In which ſpace ſuch effectual means was uſed, as the ruine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> light on the head of the Enemy, and <hi>Haman</hi> changed with <hi>Mordecai</hi> his advancement in Court for that on a Gibbet, which he had prepared for him. <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> and <hi>cap.</hi> 8.15. When <hi>Paul</hi> was apprehended by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſacrificing knife of death putting to his throat, the chief Captains Advent in the Interim occaſions his reſcue and reprieve from their purpoſed Execution. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.32. And ſo again, when more than forty Blood-hounds wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his precious life, longing like ſo many Leeches to ſuck out his heart-blood, having bound themſelves in a deſperate and develliſh Oath, or banned themſelves into an Obligation to make him their Sacrifice, his Siſters ſon certifies the <hi>Centurion,</hi> who carries him away by force out of their hands upon the young mans information; ſo that, though in very great danger of his life, he eſcaped ſafe. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.20.

The People of God many times when under fears of ſurprizal, or treading upon the very brink, and precipice of danger, in the way of their duty, have been

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, By diverting evil men in their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious executions. As no plot of darkneſs ſo deep, but God gives his people ſome light of it even when the train be laid, and there wants nothing but <hi>Give Fire:</hi> So no reſolution ſo firm or fixed, but he can put a ſtop to it. God can cut off even the Spirit of Lions, and make the heart of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> tremble at the ſhaking of a leaf; diſpirit and diſcourage wicked men in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly enterpriſes, and if not, yet divert, ſo as if their courage and heart holds good and fails not, yet he finds their hands other picking-work. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is marching in his full carier, and driving furiouſly againſt Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a <hi>Sic volo</hi> in his mouth, I will purſue, I will over-take and divide the Spoil, God can take off his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot-wheels, and ſo ſmite him in the hinder parts, as he ſhall drive heavily, and be glad to retreat and go back (if he might) as faſt as he came. When <hi>Saul</hi> grows outragious againſt <hi>David,</hi> and was mad of taking him, being ſo earneſt and eager in his purſuit, that he ſolemnly avoucheth, that if he were in the land, he would ſearch for him through all the thouſands of <hi>Judah,</hi> and by ſearch had found him, and compaſſed him round about, got him in a nook, a pound (as it were) and he thought he was cock-ſure of him, comes ſudden news of an Invaſion by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> which diſpatch makes him deſiſt his purſuit after a ſingle perſon, and take care about his Land. When proud inſulting <hi>Sennacherib</hi> comes out
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62588:35"/>againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> full mouth, God ſtops him by the overthrow of an Angel, ſo that he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, nor ſhot an arrow there, nor came before it with Shields, nor caſt a bank againſt it, but by the way that he came, by the ſame he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.33, 34. God hath all his Peoples enemies, Satan and his Inſtruments, not only in the Chain of a finite Nature, but alſo a powerfull Providence, and can hinder them not only from doing all they would, but all that otherwiſe they could againſt them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By convincing the Adverſary of his Peoples Integrity, and reconciling them to his People. They that fear the Lord, he hath ſaid, He will make his Enemies to be at peace with them, ſo as they ſhall ſay as the King of <hi>Judah</hi> to the King of <hi>Iſrael, I am as thou art, and my Horſes as thy Horſes;</hi> or as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Let there be no Controverſie between us, becauſe we are brethren.</hi> He can not only divert their hands, but convert their hearts. The hearts of all men are in his hand, and he can turn them as the Rivers of waters. He can enamour thoſe that dwell in <hi>Sodom</hi> with the excellency of the Citizens of <hi>Sion.</hi> He can make a <hi>Balaam</hi> who comes out with an intent to abaſe and curſe his People, break out into higheſt ſtrains of admiration and bleſſing. <hi>How goodly are thy Tents O Jacob, and thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles O Iſrael! Who can count the duſt of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Iſrael?</hi> It's God's promiſe to his Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, The labour of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>and the</hi> Sabeans <hi>ſhall come over to thee, and they ſhall be thine, and they ſhall come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62588:35"/>after thee, in chains they ſhall come over: And they ſhall fall down to thee, they ſhall make ſupplication to thee, ſaying, Surely God is in thee, and there is none elſe, there is no God.</hi> A ſtrange and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious reſpect ſhewn to the Church by exterous Nations, and to her Members born there. God can ſo captivate ſinners with the Beauty of the Saints graces, as they, who were their Oppoſers, ſhould now think it their duty to become her Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and their Perſecutors eſteem it their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be not her Penſioners only, but her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and Captives. The Miracle done on the three Children, extorted an acknowledgement from the Heathen King, of the truth of their God and Worſhip and changed his minde, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.28. and <hi>Daniels</hi> deliverance, of his Majeſty and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And the Apoſtles Miniſtry and Miracles drew forth the Peoples Confeſſion, <hi>Theſe are the Servants of the living God.</hi> Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, whole Armies when coming forth in the heat of their rage, have thrown down their weapons at the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the goings forth of the God of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and as <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> wept over the necks of thoſe whom they purpoſed to tread upon. So effectual is the ſenſe of Religion, as where it doth not convert, it doth at leaſt reſtrain, and bridles the paſſions, where it reconciles not the affections. It is eaſie, and hath been ordinary with God, to incline the hearts of Enemies, and turn them towards his People. Thus God dealt with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when <hi>Laban</hi> purſu'd him, he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenerate his heart, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 31.29, 42. with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his Maſter on the falſe Informations of his Miſtreſs, impriſoned him, he found favour in the

So <hi>Eſther, Mordecai,</hi> and the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> though ſentenced by a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Decree to utter deſtruction, found not only (upon her applications, and the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition into the Rolls produced, containing the record of his former ſervice) a relaxtion of the ſentence, and the one great Preferment, while the other ſure eſtabliſhment; but an Order and Expreſs under the hand of that <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch for the Temples re-edification. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the Princes and Courtiers (who maligned, and ſpleen'd his advancement) turned informers of his Non-addreſſes to the King, and his addreſſes to his God, God works a Miracle for him, rather than they ſhall work him out of favour; And as his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of dreams gat him his honour, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.46. ſo theſe ſignal appearances on his behalf kept and retained him it, <hi>cap.</hi> 6.

When they were in their travails, God fenced off all injuries from them; <hi>he ſuffered no man to do them wrong,</hi> Pſal. 105.14.

            <p>Now God (under the deluge of judgements) is an help to his people three manner of waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By removing them out of the reach of them; ſecuring them from their dint and ſtroke. Sometimes he removes their ſouls to Heaven, and lodgeth their bodies in the chambers of the grave. He takes his out of a ſinful and miſerable world before the Judgement commenceth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. Thus he took <hi>Joſiah</hi> up into the chambers of heavenly glory, before the ſtorm came on <hi>Iſraels</hi> head. He baild off the arreſt his life time, but no ſooner is he dead and gone, but iſſues out her writ of remove out of his ſight. Thus God took away <hi>Auſtin</hi> a little before <hi>Hippo</hi> was ſackt, and <hi>Pareus</hi> a little before <hi>Heidelburgh</hi> was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Luther</hi> (according to his own prayer, that he might not live to ſee the Plagues of God coming on an ungodly world) before the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> troubles brake forth. God removes his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62588:40"/>people by an <hi>habeas corpus</hi> out of this lower world, and then comes down its execution. And the greateſt ſtorm of outward Judgements, hath no further effect on the godly, than to drive them to their Fathers houſe, or moſt boiſterous wind of calamity, than to blow them home to their deſired Haven. When God had informed <hi>Daniel</hi> of ſuch a time of trouble coming on the world as never was ſince there was a Nation, even under the perſecution by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeth him with his <hi>quietus eſt, Cap.</hi> 12, 13. Go thou thy way till the end be; for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in the lot in the end of the daies. When Gods peoples race be run, their work done and finiſht, he gives them a diſpenſation for tarrying any longer in the world, or managing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and duty here below; plucks them off the ſtage, and ſends them to Heaven to reſt from their labours, and receive their reward, prepared for them, and promiſed to them. Sometimes God removes them out of the verge of trouble on earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, and ſhut thy doors round about thee, and hide thy ſelf as it were for a little moment, till the indignation be overpaſt.</hi> God hath chambers of diſtinguiſhing providence, and of gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whither he lovingly invites his people as one friend does another diſtant from his own home, and overtaken with a ſtorm, to come in and ſhelter himſelf till it be blown over. God hath hiding-places, places of retirement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for his people under publick out-goings of his Majeſty, and his wrath and juſtice againſt the inhabitants of the earth. When the world lies
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62588:41"/>open and naked to the ſtorm of divine vengeance, as a man in rain without a covering, or in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel without a defence, and feel the ſmart of it, the godly are priviledg'd and protected: when the avenger of blood comes, they have their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. They are Gods marked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. His ſealed ones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. They are hid in the day of his anger, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. Who dare meddle with what God hath marked, or break what he hath ſealed? or who can touch what he hath hid? when the deſtroyer ſmote all the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he paſſed by the doors that were ſprinkled, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. When God comes to ſweep the Kitchin of the world with the beſome of deſolation, he hath a Parlour of ſpecial providence, or other rooms of retirement to turn his people into, ſo as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge ſhall not come nigh them. Though not all, or perhaps many, yet have not ſome of Gods Servants providentially been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the reach of the preſent Plague, and perhaps the late Fire alſo? <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports, that a little before the final deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the godly Jews in the City, in time of the ſiege, heard a voice in the Air, crying, <hi>Ite Pellam, Ite Pellam,</hi> a little Village thereby, whither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them fled, and ſo were preſerved. When the Town be taken, God receives his into Caſtle, which leads to the ſecond way of divine help in common evils.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By diſtinguiſhing them in the day of calamity: Sparing their perſons and families in the day of his wrath. If God hides them not from the Judgement, yet he does in it. We have a promiſe of a ſpecialty to be granted,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62588:41"/>
               <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>A Book of remembrance was written before him for them which feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name.</hi> While others were ſentenced to death, their names were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred <hi>(in albo beatorum)</hi> in the book of the living. <hi>And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels.</hi> Whatſoever becomes of the lumber and common houſhold-ſtuff, though that be conſumed by the fire of his wrath, God will look to his choicer Treaſure, and keep that ſafe and ſecure. <hi>And I will ſpare them, as a man ſpares his own Son that ſerves him.</hi> Though their ſins deſerve they ſhould be turned out of doors, as well as others, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the wind and weather of common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, yet God hath a covering both for their ſins and ſouls.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It imports ſuccour and redreſſe under burdens, or deliverance out of dangers feared, ſtraits and miſeries, injuries, oppreſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions felt, Pſal. 20.1, 2. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the Name of the God of Jacob de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee.

This is an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to a gracious Soul; his Iniquities go over his head, and are a burden too heavy for him to bear. One ſin weighs more than Hell, ſet home upon the Conſcience by the Impreſſions of Gods Spirit; it oppreſſeth it very ſore.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62588:45"/>as Chriſt himſelf (though but imputed) could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have undergone, had not his Humanity been ſupported by the power of his Deity, but muſt have ſunk under the Oppreſſion of it.

Though this might be a Fiction taken out of their golden Legend, to deceive their Proſelytes, I am ſure, it's true as to the Saints and People of God, <hi>Fuſo ſanguine

            <p>Secondly, He helps under weights of Duty and Service. It was Gods Promiſe to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he called him out to difficult ſervice, Joſh. 1.5. <hi>I will be with thee, and never fail nor forſake thee:</hi> And to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſet him upon the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous employment of an Embaſſie to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he would certainly be with him, and be a mouth to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.12. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.12. God gives forth ſtrange aſſiſtances for extraordinary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Gods people know not their ſtrength, till they have tried it, cannot tell what they can do till they come to do it. For Callings and Employments which they never thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to manage, he gives another manner of ſpirit, a double portion of his Spirit, when he ſets men over a Congregation, he pours out the gifts and graces of his Spirit on them, ſo as that holy Oyl runs down from their heads to the skirts of their Garments. He makes helpers in Government, and gives gifts to men, that though they have no ſufficiency of themſelves, yet through grace they become able Miniſters and Stewards of his myſteries. Such is divine goodneſs, as he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62588:46"/>never calls any man to ſervice, but he furniſhes him with gifts and Enablements neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Yea in ordinary ſervices he comes in as their Aſſiſtant. In Prayer, the Spirit <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. helps our infirmities, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, manner and ends of it: The word is very emphatical, and denotes a lifting at the other end of a burden, ſo that what one cannot raiſe, two eaſily lift together. What the Soul cannot do, when never ſo much raiſed by the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it can eaſily do, being alleviated and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too by the aſſiſtances of Grace. Though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out union with Chriſt, it could do nothing, yet, receiving vertue and influence from him, it can do all things, <hi>Hodiè Bernardum Herì Chriſtum; I am able</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to do all things,</hi>

This made <hi>Paul</hi> ready preſſed to ſervice, that he beggs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods Journey-man, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> God gives not only the <hi>poſſe,</hi> but the <hi>velle</hi> too; works in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure. <hi>Gratias ago tibi (Clementiſſime Domine) quod nihil à me requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiviſti, quod mihi non prius donaſti,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian.</hi> What his will commandeth, his grace <hi>beſtoweth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Under the preſſure of ſufferings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritual or temporal for God, or from God, perſonal, domeſtical or publick; God helps his under the burden of all, And that either viſibly, or ſecretly and inviſibly.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Alleviando,</hi> by mitigating and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them. He gives them at leaſt a little help,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62588:46"/>as he promiſeth the ſufferers under <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s perſecution, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.34. grants them ſome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as he aſſures <hi>Judah</hi> againſt <hi>Shiſhak:</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6. He gives them a Nail in his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and a little reviving, ſome ſhort breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, <hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> Ezra 9.8. Silence for half an hour, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.1. He corrects them but in meaſure, though he leaves them not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unpuniſht, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 44. <hi>ult.</hi> He ſmites them not, as he do's his enemies, them that ſmote him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.7. He lays on his little finger, but not his loyns, he chaſtens with rods, (whips not with Scorpions) and thoſe too the rods of men, of an old man (in the original) who cannot ſtrike any conſiderable ſtroak. He remembers his Peoples frame, and conſiders that they are but duſt, and will not contend for ever, leſt the Spirit ſhould fail before him, which he hath made. <hi>He ſtayes his rough winde in the day of his Eaſt winde:</hi> He regards not what we deſerve, but what we can endure, and never ſo beholds us Sinners, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get us Creatures, or deals with us according to the greatneſs of his Power, or exactneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Juſtice, but with abundant mixtures of Mercy and Love. In the midſt of Wrath he remembers Mercy, and never lets out all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of his indignation, and though he forſakes for a moment, with great kindneſs will he gather. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Liberando,</hi> by Redeeming his <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of all their troubles. Many are the troubles of his Righteous, but the Lord delivers out of them all. He is with them in ſix troubles, and in ſeven no evil toucheth them, <hi>Job</hi> 5.17. and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62588:47"/>though their troubles be full and perfect, ſo ſhall be their deliverances. If he preſerves them not from trouble, he will ſave them in it, and deliver them by it, yea, out of it. <hi>He that hath delivered, doth deliver, and will deliver,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Satan or the World are not ſo ready to afflict, as he is to redeem or comfort. He delivers <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of the Priſon, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> out of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lions Den, the Three Children out of the Fire, Peter out of the Goal. He delivers his from reproach, clearing up their innocency as the Sun at Noon-day; from want and beggery, by raiſing them up Families like a Flock; <hi>He raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the Beggar from the dunghill, to ſet them among Princes,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.8. He delivers them from ſickneſs by recovery of them from the bed of their languiſhing; delivers them from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, by ſubduing at their foot the Sons of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and giving them (to tread on) the necks of their adverſaries. No temptation befalls them, but he gives a way of eſcape.—</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, more inſenſibly and indiſcernably. He helps them under their ſufferings,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſupplying them with neceſſary influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Grace; He cauſeth all Grace to abound in them, Faith, and Patience, Self-denial, Humility, Heavenly-mindedneſs, to have its perfect work; gives them all Graces in their power and efficacy, vigour and activity; makes the ſpirit of Glory to reſt upon them. As they have <hi>doing</hi> ſo <hi>ſuffering</hi> Grace from Heaven. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you is given not only to believe, but ſuffer</hi>— They have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and aſſiſtance too to bleed for Chriſt as well

Thus <hi>David</hi> helpt the people when he purſued the <hi>Amalekites</hi> (who had burnt up their City, and taken their wives and goods) and recovered all, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.19. Thus a man help; his neighbour, when he furniſhes him at an unexpected diſappointment, or preſſing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as he in the Parable did his friend with the loaves at his need. Thus the Sea-man helps the ſhipwrackt, when (the ſhip being ſplit all to pieces, and he floating on the top of the waters, and ſwiming to ſave his life) he receives him into his boat, or veſſel, and carries him ſafely to ſhore. And in this ſenſe is God an help unto his people; <hi>ſecunda tabula poſt naufragium,</hi> a plank after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, when all hope of being ſaved being gone, he comes in with unexpected relief. And this I conceive the proper notion of the Pſalmiſt here, whoſe deſign is to proclaim the ſufficiency of Gods help in the deficiency or treachery of all creatures in never ſo high an orb, of never ſo powerful an influence here below in this world. And ſo God is an help to his, both under the failure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected mercies and comforts, and alſo under the feeling of unexpected evils.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Under the failure of our expectations. When we look for peace, and no good comes; and for healing, and behold nothing but trouble: When our eyes fail, with beholding vanity, and our hearts fail with creature-reliances, then ſaith <hi>David, Whom have I in Heaven but thee? my fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73.26.

God ſaies to his people (as <hi>Peter</hi> once to Chriſt) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torms it infinitely better. <hi>Though all forſake thee, yet will not I, I will die with thee rather than deny thee.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Lord ſtood with me, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me — God came near, when man ſtood aloof off, and at the greateſt diſtance. When men, friends and relations, turn the back, and run away from us, then God ſtands at our back, and draws cloſer to us. That's the diſſerence between God and creatures: They in the halcyon daies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity will complement us into an opinion of their reſpect and kindneſs, even as the ſhadow
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62588:50"/>follows the Sun, ſo do they wait on thoſe to whom they are pretenders — <hi>Donec eris foelix</hi> — but few are born for a day of adverſity, and will girt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (like the Travelers coat) cloſer, and unite firmer to our intereſt in a day of miſery and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.

Though all the company be gone, the Phyſician and Nurſe abide ſtill with the Patient. <hi>David</hi> becomes a reproach to his neighbours, and a ſear to his acquaintance; his very look was ſo ghaſtly as frighted them; no ſooner they ſaw him, but they fled from him; they forgat him as a dead man, out of mind he was, as well as ſight. <hi>He looked for ſome to take pity, but there was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62588:50"/>none; and for comforters, but there was none; he was like a Pellican in the wilderneſs, an Owl in the deſart, and a Sparrow on the houſe top;</hi> brought to a ſolitary, forſaken, forlorn condition; yet when all other friends and lovers abſented, his God was ſtill with him, his face ſhined upon him; he heard his poor, and deſpiſed not his priſoner; he looked down on him from the height of his Sanctuary, had reſpect to his groaning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the prayer of the deſtitute. Whom the world turns off, God commonly receives; whom they caſt out of their company, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his ever-bleſſed communions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5.

When they know not whither to go, he hath for his the words of eternal life, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.68.

Such expectations raiſe it beyond its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertue, and innate efficacy. And when we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62588:51"/>look for more, God may juſtly let us finde leſs than it may otherwiſe afford us. And ſometimes God on purpoſe breaks the ſtaff of creature-comforts, to learn us ſole d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pendance on himſelf. As is reported of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, when he firſt came over into this our Iſland, he burnt all his ſhips, thereby to render to his ſouldiers the thoughts of a return deſperate. God will have his have no other ſtrings to the bow of their truſt, but his majeſty and mercy. And as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies finde in the world leſs than we expected, ſo in God more, than we could reaſonably hope. He makes good to the enjoyer what he promiſed to the expectant, and is better to his people, not only than their fears, but their deſires and hopes. He never leaves his people deſolate, though for a time he may make them diſconſolate. In all ſtraights he hath a reſerve, and exigencies a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſuccour. Under ſpiritual diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the want of Ordinances, and neceſſary means of Grace; he can prepare a table in the wilderneſs. He fed <hi>Iſrael</hi> with Manna there forty years together. He hath promiſed to be a little Sanctuary to his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16. for retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo for refreſhment. He affords the gracious ſoul ſweet repaſts by the manifeſtations of his preſence; as he did <hi>David</hi> when baniſht from his inheritance by the Sons of violence. Under outward diſappointments, and want of creature-accommodations, he can make a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proviſion. When <hi>Elijah</hi> is ready to famiſh, he can make a Raven to undertake his Caterſhip, and when he ſits ſolitary under a Juniper-tree, hand him a collation by an Angel as his Servitor.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62588:51"/>And a modicum with his bleſſing, is better than the greateſt multiplication without it. <hi>For man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of the mouth of God,</hi> Matth. 4. He fills his peoples hearts with food and gladneſs. He can carſe much; while the meat is in ſinners mouths, he can ſend leanneſs into their ſouls, and they may eat, but not have enough, drink, but not be filled, be clothed, but not be warm: So he can bleſs a little; <hi>Daniel</hi>'s pulſe he can render more nouriſhing than the Kings dainties. Though the ſtaff of bread be broken in pieces, yet he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it, or at leaſt deal graciouſly with the ſoul, ſo as it ſhall ſay, I have enough. <hi>Nimis avarus animus, cui non ſufficit Deus. Bernard.</hi> The experience of this was that gave the Church ſuch a large feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of joy in a faſting-day, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines; the labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off in the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls: yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> And as in the want of neceſſary competencies for outward and bodily ſuſtenance; ſo in the loſs of worldly conveniencies, God is his peoples helper. He recompenſeth them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold; what they loſe in temporals, they gain in ſpirituals; and when bereaved of all this world can afford, can yet cry out, we have enough, all in our God. Though they be as having nothing, yet they poſſeſs all things, and retain their heirſhip, while they appear to the world to have loſt their Sonſhip — Yea in the utmoſt miſgivings of their ſouls, when not only their enjoyments, but even
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62588:52"/>their expectancies are thrown over-board, and ſet all on float, their hope periſht from the Lord, yet his compaſſions bear them up, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21. And when with <hi>Jonah,</hi> they apprehend themſelves caſt out of his ſight, yet can they look towards his holy Temple, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4.</p>
            <p>Yea ſecondly, As under the fruſtration of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected comforts, ſo under the feeling of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected croſſes and afflictions is God their help. God is never far from his people, when trouble is near: When men draw back, he draws moſt near, and miſery advanceth forward; he never goes away and leaves them naked combatants with it. If outward mercies fail, he will give contentation under the want of them, or better mercies inſtead of them; exchanges the gold of Heaven for this earthly droſs: (Though others have the portions, they have with <hi>Iſaac</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the men of the world gifts, with <hi>Jehoram,</hi> they have the Kingdom, and change of worldly comforts, for the hopes of future glory, and a double portion of the gifts and graces of his Spirit, is no robbery or injury.) Yea he often beſtows better in kind, as well as value; as he gives them himſelf, who is better than many wives, children, eſtates, (for when all theſe die, he yet lives) ſo he raiſeth up other comforts to ſweeten their croſſes: when he takes away one mercy, ſends another in the ſtead. If <hi>David</hi> loſeth his child, which ſurviving had been a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monument of his ſhame, he ſhall have a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that ſhall be to him a Crown of Glory in his ſtead: So, if outward afflictions approach, he will finde out a way of deliverance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62588:52"/>The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of all temptations. Troubles ruſh in upon us ſuddenly oftentimes, and we know not which way we come into them, but God makes our way out of them. He opens for us a back-door of eſcape, when there appears of it no humane probability. Many a time did he deliver them; ſaith the Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 106.42. <hi>They cried unto the Lord, and he delivered them out of their diſtreſſes.</hi> Under ſoul-conflicts, when they have even concluded their caſe deſperate, God hath come in with his ſalvation.

When the ſoul is reduced to ſuch extremities, as it knows not what to do, how any longer to hope, but draws up deſperate concluſions againſt mercy, and ſaies, <hi>The Lord will be gracious no more;</hi> he hath in anger ſhut up his tender mercies, I ſhall ſurely fall by the ſtrength of this corruption, that temptation: (As Mris. <hi>Honywood</hi> ſaid) <hi>As ſure as this Glaſs breaks, I ſhall be damned.</hi>) The ſoul lookt for comfort from Ordinances, and Promiſes; expected help from faithful Miniſters, and fellow-Chriſtians, but findes none to ſave, none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; even then he findes out ſome Meſſenger, an Interpreter, one among a thouſand to ſhew to man his uprightneſs; then he is gracious, and delivers him from going down to the pit; he delights in the Almighty, and lifts up his face to God. <hi>Job cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>cap.</hi> 33. And ſo under outward ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, which come ſo ſuddenly and violently,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62588:53"/>as there ſeems no way of reſcue or reſiſtance, but a man cries out with <hi>David, He ſhall, muſt one day fall by the hand of Saul,</hi> by the power of this or the other affliction, yet God delivers out of the mouths of theſe ravening Lions; as he did him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in mine haſte, I am cut off from before thine eyes; nevertheleſs thou heardſt the voice of my ſupplications when I cried unto thee.</hi> Though he were even at deaths door, at the graves mouth, God brought up his ſoul from the grave, and kept him alive, that he went not down into the pit. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed him, and the pains of Hell got hold upon him, and he ſaid in his haſte, all were lyars,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and all; yet at length God gave him ſuch experience of his ſalvation, as he could not contain, but cries out, <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</hi> It's Gods uſual method to work by contraries, and as he diſappoints ſinners in the height of their hopes and confidences; ſo he relieves his Saints in the loweſt ebbs of their diffidencies and deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; he caſts them down when advanced on the higheſt pinnacle of undeſerved, and abuſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and lifts his own up, when plunged into the moſt deep and intricate labyrinths of affliction and miſery. And that is the laſt particular in this firſt branch of the Propoſition. In what reſpects God is an help to his people.</p>
            <p>The ſecond follows: How, or after what ſort and manner he gives them help. Take it briefly in theſe following particulars, which will enhance the excellency of divine help.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He helps ſuddenly and unexpectedly,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62588:53"/>when his people little dream of it, leaſt of all look for it, and expect it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1. When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion, we were like them that dream. The deliverance was ſo great as it ſeems incredible, too good news to be true. Wicked men build Caſtles in the Air, and dream of more mercy than they finde true; dream they eat, and when they awake, are an hungry. The godly carry a low ſail, and commonly dream of leſs. The world is commonly worſe than its promiſes, God ordinarily better than his word. Sinners meet with leſs, Saints more than they expected. God, with a breath blows the wicked into deſtruction, and with a breath commands his peoples deliverance. Their ruin is ſudden; how does deſolation come upon them in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they are conſumed with Gods terrours? When <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſo pleaſed with her ſelf, that ſhe courts her ſelf like a Lady, God can make her a Widow. As gliding waters, melting ſnales, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely births, ſo is their proſperity, and as a ſudden flame, or unlookt for H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rricane, comes their miſery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.9. And no leſs expected are Sions reparations. It's compared to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.18. which is ſuddenly effected, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which is <hi>in inſtanti:</hi> Nay, before ſhe travelled, ſhe brought forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.7, 8. She is delivered before her time, and without pain, and yet does not miſcarry. Yea, and as her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance comes unexpectedly as to time, ſo to means likewiſe, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.10. <hi>Be in pain, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring forth, O Daughter of Sion, like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travel; Thou ſhalt go even to Babylon, there ſhalt thou be delivered.</hi> An enemy ſhall become
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62588:54"/>her Midwife, who ſought to be her murderer. It's but the ſhine of Gods face, and his people are ſaved, <hi>Pſal</hi> 80. <hi>ult.</hi> But the turn of his hand, and his people are delivered, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. He ſaies, <hi>return,</hi> his word can do it as well as his work, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90.3. Judgements come on foot, but mercy on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, on the wing, skipping over the hills, and leaping over the mountains. No ſooner do Gods people cry to him in prayer, but he eccho's to them in mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.9. <hi>Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer: Thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here am I.</hi> As Gods people anſwer to his voice commanding, <hi>Speak Lord, thy Servants hear;</hi> ſo he anſwers to their voice petitioning, <hi>Call upon me, and I will anſwer thee,</hi> Jer. 33.3. He cuts ſhort his work in righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gradually; though ſalvation comes ſuddenly, yet not <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> all at once is it compleated and perfected. It's compared to light, which creeps upon the Air <hi>pedetentim,</hi> by little and little. The dawning of the day goes before the high noon. God works for his people, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after divers waies and manners: by piece-meals and inches, as it were. Sion is not built in a day. God could deſtroy his peoples luſts, and their enemies together, but he ſlaies them not, leſt they ſhould forget. He could at once perfect the building of grace in the ſoul, and work of reformation in his Church, but he chuſeth to let it have its ſtages; firſt laies the foundation, then laies on the ſuperſtructures, and ſo at laſt perfects the fabrick, that ſo he may have the greater tribute and revenue of praiſes and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62588:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>acclamations coming into his Grace. God is a God that waits to be gracious to his people; but he is alſo a God of Judgement. They ſhall get ground, but yet muſt be fighting; they ſhall have ſupply, yet muſt be waiting. The prudent Father will not give his child his whole portion into his hand at once; nor the diſcreet friend truſt all the ſtock he intends to his friend together, but help them by degrees according to their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and occaſions; thereby to engage their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependance upon them. Leſſer motions are ordinarily quick, but great motions ſlower. God gives the wicked Prodigal all in hand, whom he hath no further thoughts of good will, and purpoſes of grace and love unto; but in reſpect of his people, he does all for eternity; and therefore with the skilfull Artiſts, draws not up his work in haſte, but takes time to make it the more beautiful and admirable. God is the Saviour of his people, and yet ſometimes like the curious Limner, hides his work till the whole draught be compleated, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15. <hi>Verily thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael, the Saviour.</hi> He carries on the work in a very hidden and myſterious way, by ſo many aenigma's and riddles of providence, as his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps cannot eaſily be traced, nor his handy-work ſearcht out to perfection. There are many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto's in his mercies and ſalvations, many <hi>Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezers,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. <hi>He called the name of it Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer, ſaying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He helps opportunely and ſeaſonably, in the very preſent emergency, and ſtrait, in the hour, the nick of trouble. Opportunity is the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62588:55"/>Salt that ſeaſons any mercy. Now God times all his helps and ſuccours to his people. As he dealt with Chriſt, ſo with them; <hi>In an acceptable time he hears them, and in the day of ſalvation he helps them.</hi> He is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a God at a pinch; <hi>In the Mount will he be ſeen</hi> — when his own arm ſhall be the more conſpicuous; or when his people are in eminent and imminent dangers. When the murdering-knife is putting to <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s throat, he plucks back <hi>Abraham</hi>'s hand. When the Canon is diſcharging againſt the Jews, then he muzzles the mouth of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. <hi>For the Lord ſhall judge his people, and repent himſelf for his Servants; when he ſeeth that their power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left.</hi> When the ſiege can hold no longer (and there's none left in the fenced Cities, more than in the open Plains) then forthwith comes relief. <hi>This is the day of Jacob's trouble; alas, for that day is great, and there is none like it, but he ſhall be ſaved out of it,</hi> Jer. 30.7. Daies of great trouble, are daies of glorious ſalvation. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in a very great diſtreſs, like to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and upon their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God he turns them off, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation that he would deliver them no more; yet pleading the inſtancy of their oppreſſion, and begging relief in the preſent exigency <hi>(Deliver us only we pray thee this day)</hi> His ſoul was grieved for their miſery, and his pity became ſollicitor to his power in order to their ſuccour and redreſs, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.16. When the ſoul like <hi>Jonah,</hi> in the Whales belly, is even ſwallowed up of ſorrow, and out of the depths, the belly of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62588:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hell, cries to the Lord, <hi>He will hear him.</hi> God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath ſaid, <hi>He will bring his people back from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1.20. Prayer put up to Heaven by a ſoul ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o ſink in the mire, as being able to finde no ſtanding, is alwaies in an acceptable time: That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſimum fandi tempus,</hi> Pſal. 69.13. Gods help is limited to no time, but there are uſually two ſpecial ſeaſons when the fruit of mercy is full ripe, and God plucks it off the tree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and throws it into the laps of his people; either when their enemies condition is high, and they triumphant, or his peoples low, and they deſpondent and deſperate.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The influx of divine help is then ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable under the enemies rage, height and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, when they blaſpheme the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſay, <hi>Where is their God become?</hi> There is no help for him in his God; Ah ſo would we have it; God hath forſaken him, perſecute him, and take him; there is none to deliver him; we offend not, they have ſinned againſt the Lord, the habitation of Juſtice, the hope of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. God then will make no delay, but make haſte for their help: When the malignant Church vaunted it againſt the true (as the debaucht Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot againſt the chaſte Miſtreſs) ſhe returns her this anſwer, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8, 10. <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy, Though I fall, I ſhall riſe: She that is mine enemy ſhall ſee it, and ſhame ſhall cover her, which ſaid to me, Where is the Lord thy God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Under the Saints ſuccumbency, when they ſeem to be ſwallowed up quick of the rage of their adverſary; to fall by the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62588:56"/>to be in ſuch an eſtate as they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and winde themſelves out by all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and induſtry; yea, are ready to conclude, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken them, and there is no hope;</hi> their hope is periſhed, their way hid, and their Judgement paſſed over from their God; it's in vain, and they will wait on the Lord no longer, are ready to leave off, and quite give over pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting, hoping and believing; their ſpirits fail them, and they are ready to put forth their hand to iniquity; their extremity is his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. This is that <hi>David</hi> urgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70. <hi>ult. I am poor and needy, O God, thou art my help and deliverer.</hi> And ſo the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>ult. Our ſoul is bowed down to the duſt, and our belly cleaves to the Earth; Ariſe for our help</hi> — When Gods ſervants know not what to do, <hi>in ipſa hora dabitur;</hi> and when they are expoſed to great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and oppreſſions, it repents the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their groanings, by reaſon of them who oppreſs and vex them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.18. <hi>I have ſeen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and heard their cry by reaſon of their Task-maſters, and I know their ſorrows:</hi> And when their ſighing and crying came up before God by reaſon of their bondage, he thought them meet for deliverance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.24. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.7, 9. The Rabbins have a proverb, <hi>Cum duplicantur lateres venit Moſes,</hi> when the tale of Bricks was doubled, then comes <hi>Moſes</hi> a deliverer out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Nothing fetcheth down Judgement from Heaven ſooner than the cry of <hi>Sodoms</hi> ſins, nor mercy, than of Sions ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. God regards the prayers of the deſtitute, hears the groaning of his Turtles, appointed for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62588:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>death, of his priſoners, deſtin'd for deſtruction. Their mourning weeds, furrowed faces, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſobbing hearts are ſilent but potent Orators at the Throne of Heaven for relief and ſuccour. God gives his Enemies a looſe rein for a while, but when they grow extravagant the limit; he hath ſet them, he pulls at the Curb; and he layes the rod on his people to laſh them for their ſins, but if once it fetcheth tears from their eyes, and brings them to weeping Croſs, he ſpares further correction, and throws it into the fire.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God helps his People invincibly and irreſtiſtibly. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zach. 4.6. What is this Mountain before <hi>Zerubbabel?</hi> As he works by an inſuperable grace in the heart, ſo by an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power in the world. <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Canticle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.6. <hi>The right hand of the Lord doth valiantly,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.15. The right hand is commonly the Inſtrument of action, and the ſeat of power. God ſaves by his right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.8. by it he can work, and none ſhall let him, nothing is too hard for him. For if the very weakneſs of God (to ſpeak as to our capacity) be infinitely too much for the ſtrength of man, what is the ſtrength of God to the weakneſs of men? <hi>He is wonderful in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and mighty in working,</hi> Jer. 32.17, 19. He hath power to help, and power to caſt down, as the Man of God tells <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25.8. The arm of Creatures is but an Arm of fleſh, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> tells the People to encourage them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi>'s revilings, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.8. <hi>With
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62588:57"/>him is an arm of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battels.</hi> So able is God to help, that he can do the work alone, though there be none elſe to help. He is the Lord alone, and beſides him is there no Saviour, and he can ſave alone, without any uſe of Inſtruments and ſecond Cauſes. As <hi>Jeheſophat</hi> tells the People, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Ye need not fight in this baſtel, the Lord your God fighteth for you.</hi> And ſo he did, by making their Enemies their own deſtroyers, while his People went out with Songs inſtead of Weapons, and ſtruck not a ſtroke, only ſang a Pſalm of Thankſgiving, they became each others Butchers, and Executioners, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22, 23. And ſo it was in <hi>Midian</hi>'s deſtruction, <hi>Gideon</hi> and his Souldiers, go out with Lamps and Pitchers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Military Engines, and not a Sword drawn, or Drum beaten, only a ſhout given, and the Lord ſets every mans Sword againſt his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low throughout the whole Hoſt. <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.22. Here was the Finger of God evidently manifeſted for his People againſt their Enemies, in making them ſpend their Arrows one on another. So dealt God alſo with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that they confeſſed the Lord fought againſt them for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 14.25. Here was the immediate hand of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Gods Providence can eaſily diſcover, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, or diſcomfit his Enemies, making their own fears their ſnare, as he did the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.6. Yea, ſuch is Gods Omnipotency, that though there be never ſo many letts and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, reſiſtances and oppoſitions, he can leap over all. If he hath none to help, there ſhall be none ſhall hinder. If he cannot finde his way,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62588:57"/>(with <hi>Hannibal</hi>) he will make it; he can make every hill a Plain. Notwithſtanding all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he can work his intentions, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his Purpoſes both in the World, and in the Heart. Though violent temptations aſſail, and ſtrong corruptions oppoſe, ſo as the Sons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi> ſeem to be too hard for the Soul, grace can triumph over all difficulties and diſcouragements, and level all towring thoughts, and ſoaring ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and bring it into the obedience of the juſt. There is no difficulty to omnipotency. He can cauſe the work of his Temple to go on in troublous times, and give the great things of Righteouſneſs and Reformation which have met with nothing but a miſcarrying Womb, and dry Breaſts, ſtrength to conceive, and alſo to bring forth. And the deſigns of Enemies he can make all abortive. The wiſeſt Counſellor againſt his Church he can make his own Executioner, and cauſe him to exchange his badge of honour for an ignominious Halter, 2 <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> 17.23. Though <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek</hi> conſpire, he can blow on their Confederacies by the breath of his noſtrils. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> who lets, he can remove out of the way, and make the little Horn puſh the Nations, and the intereſt of the Lamb break in pieces the Kingdom of the Beaſt, though his followers be even innumerable. Hence it's worthy our obſervation, that he chooſeth to appear for his People in a very low condition, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23.) that ſo <hi>aliquid divini</hi> might appear in all his Manifeſtations. He overlooks his People, when erect as the Palm; or ſpreading forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the green Bay-tree, and looks upon them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62588:58"/>when like the Myrtle they dwell in a low place. Such is the power of his Providence in his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for his Servants, as in Scripture-phraſe it obtains the name of a Reſurrection, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof is requiſite no loſs than an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and omnipotent Arm, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. when they are as dry bones, and ſcattered, he can command a re-entrance of the ſpirit, a return of life: To which metaphor <hi>David</hi> alludes in his Prayer and Invocation for help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7, 8. <hi>Our bones are ſcattered at the graves mouth, as when one cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and cleaveth Wood upon the earth. But mine eyes are to thee, O God, the Lord: in thee is my truſt, leave not my ſoul deſtitute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly: He help; them proportionably. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom diſpenſeth Mercy by an even bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance unto its receivers, by a juſt proportion, and that fourfold: To His Peoples <hi>wants, deſires, hopes</hi> and <hi>expectations,</hi> and their <hi>good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To their Wants and Neceſſities. Gods ſupply ever reſpects mans indigency. The worlds rule is, <hi>Habenti dabitur.</hi> The Rich have many Friends: The more men have, the more they would, and ſhall have. <hi>But this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him.</hi> He is an helper of the Fatherleſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. and ſo its ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.12, 13. <hi>He ſhall deliver the needy when he crieth, the poor alſo, and him that hath no helper,</hi>— Poor Orphans, who are too commonly the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Worlds oppreſſion, are the Objects of Gods and Chriſts compaſſion and commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was <hi>Job</hi>'s teſtimony of his integrity, that he <hi>delivered the poor that cried, the fatherleſs,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62588:58"/>and him that had none to help him,</hi> Job 29.12. cap. 31.21. and its a Rule of Equity obſerved in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Gods relief loves to lift up thoſe whom the ſenſe of their own wants hath caſt down. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hath a loud voice, and prevailing with the Almighty. Mans iniſery, it's <hi>anſa divinae miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae.</hi> God pours the Oyl and Wine of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation into broken hearts, wounded ſpirits. Drooping and dejected hearts may moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expect health from the light of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Phyſitians countenance. The World leaves us, when we moſt want it, and Creatures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us, when we have moſt need, but then God ſtands by us. When the hour of ſickneſs comes, he alwayes gives his people the ſweeteſt Viſits of Love. Men commonly take the ſtrongeſt, but God, the weakeſt ſide. What is ſaid of Earthly Monarchs, is much more true of him the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>Parcit ſubjectis, debellat ſuperbos.</hi> He pulls down the mighty from their ſeat, and exalts them of low degree, He fills the hungry, but ſends the rich empty away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To their Prayers and Requeſts. Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the readyeſt way of having. This depends on the former, (for <hi>Oratio ſine malis quaſi Avis ſine alis.</hi> He that wants not, beggs not, or at leaſt ought not ſo to do.) But now true ſeekers are alwayes good ſpeeders. The moſt ſturdy Beggars go away with Heavens Alms, and the eagerly ſolliciting Favourites come away with grants from the Throne of Mercy.

The Kingdom of Heaven delights to ſuffer this holy Violence. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> hold down his hands and <hi>Amalek</hi> prevails, let him lift them up, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevails.

And he urgeth God with his Promiſe in prayer, which was, when evil came upon them, as the Sword, Judgement, Peſtilence, or Famine, if they cried to him in their affliction, he would hear, and help.

God loves to be truſted by his People, their Faith ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours him. He that comes to him for mercy, muſt believe his being, and his plentifull remunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and an Unbeliever muſt expect to receive nothing at the hand of the Lord.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62588:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>and be perfect, and I will be thy Shield and Buckler, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> Let God have much of the fruit of our obedience, and we may expect much of the light of his Countenance. Ordinarily, the more Ships we ſend out laden with duty, the larger returns we finde of Mercy. The more Service we do to our great and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, the more we have of Priviledge. The end of all deliverance is ſervice in holineſs and righteouſneſs, and the end of righteouſneſs is peace and aſſurance for ever; the fruit thereof is ſown in peace, and ſuch as the ſeed-time is, ſuch is the harveſt. Sin clips the wings of Mercy. God will never beſtow his Corn and Wine on them who beſtow it on themſelves and their luſts, nor truſt his mercies in their hands, who make them weapons to fight againſt him. His ſalvation is nigh them that fear him, and his bleſſing upon his people; but he will not take the ungodly by the hand, or help the evil doers, <hi>Job</hi> 8 20. Sin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates God, and a Soul, divorceth him and a People; an unthankfull or unfruitfull return of his Influences wholly ſhuts them up. No long ſhinings of his favour, where no reflections of our gratitude; no allegiance no protection, but a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the lines of the communication of his grace. While we do well and be obedient, we ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if rebellious, we ſhall be devoured with the Sword. If faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servants, he will become our gracious and affectionate Saviour, but if undutifull Sons, he will be our Judge and Corrector. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9, 10. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: In his love, and in his

But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them.</hi> His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of aſſiſtance to preſence with his People are conditional, and ſo are his performances, <hi>Dum ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> As the Seer told King <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you. And ſo much for the ſecond particular, how God helps his People.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What are the Cauſes of Divine Help, or the reaſons why God will help his People?</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In reſpect of that relation he bears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, or that right and propriety he hath in them.

They are related to him in Chriſt, that mighty one, on whom he hath laid help; though by nature afar off, yet by grace made nigh, and have a new and living way opened through his blood, whereby they draw nigh to God, and beg help and ſuccour from him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> He is the ſaving ſtrength of his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. Or by his Anointed, as ſome read, the ſtrength of their ſalvation by Chriſt. They are related to him in covenant. He is their God, and they are his people. And being their God, therefore he muſt needs become their ſalvation. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2.

            <p>Thirdly, In regard of thoſe conditions of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Divine Help, which are ever found in them. They are under a fitneſs and aptitude of diſpoſition to receive it. There are four condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or qualifications eſpecially, which make them meet for this divine influence, which are to be found in them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of Humility, or ſpiritual Poverty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart, and ſaveth them that be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit.</hi> He beholds the proud afar off, as ſcorning his tuition; but he graciouſly beholds the humble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. In him the fatherleſs finde
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62588:64"/>mercy. <hi>A Father of the fatherleſs, and Judge of the Widow is he out of his holy habitation,</hi> Pſal. 68.5, 6. The Lord helpeth thoſe that are caſt down. The Lion puts (as it were) into his boſome thoſe that bow before him, or he down at his feet, but tears in pieces them that run away from him, or bid reſiſtance to him; ſo generous and noble is his nature and diſpoſition, <hi>ſatis eſt proſtraſſe</hi> — And ſo do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> he is a Lion to lofty and ſturdy ſinners, but a Lamb to depreſſed and dejected ſouls. Such as advance themſelves to the Throne, God brings down to the footſtool, but to thoſe that patiently bear the Croſs, he reacheth forth the Crown. He revives the ſpirits of the humble, and the hearts of the contrite ones.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prayer and Invocation. Gods People are a praying people, a generation of ſeekers, and ſuch commonly are ſpeeders. God ſends none away that ſo come to him with a <hi>non inventus:</hi> He never ſaid to the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeek ye my face in vain. They ſeek his face, righteouſneſs and ſtrength, and he is found of them. When <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> was compaſſed about with the <hi>Syrian</hi> Hoſt, and had no way to fly but up to Heaven; he cries to the Lord, and he helped him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.31. The Saints alone betake themſelves to God and his help, run to him as their Sanctuary; others fly from Gods preſence, run to the Rocks, and the tops of the ragged Rocks, call to the hills and the mountains; but a child of God goes only and tells his Father, and before him laies open his cauſe. As good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, when <hi>Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> came out againſt him, O Lord, I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62588:64"/>undertake for me, or the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.2. <hi>Be thou our Arm every morning, and our ſalvation in the time of trouble.</hi> They only ſenſibly need, and ſo alone crave and implore divine ſuccour. And God will not ſuffer his People to loſe the precious treaſure of their prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18, 19. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him; to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfill the deſire of them that fear him; he will alſo hear their cry, and ſave them.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14, 15. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my Name, he ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him</hi> — That God who prepares his Peoples heart to pray, prepares alſo his own ear to hear; and he that promiſeth to hear before we call, will never deny to hearken, when we cry unto him. <hi>Ideo premuntur juſti, ut preſſi clament, clamantes exaudiantur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin.</hi> Oppreſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions make man cry, and cries and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make God hear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.1, 2. — Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth our hands in believing and ſervent prayer, is the only way of graſping mercy. God hath given full aſſurance by promiſe, of grants on ſuch applications even under the inffliction of the greateſt judgements and calamities, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8 37. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.28. — If publick mercy does not, yet particular at leaſt alwaies follows as an anſwer of prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayeſt be found:</hi> There's the voice of prayer: What is the Eccho of mercy appears in the very next words, <hi>Surely in the floods of great waters they ſhall not come nigh to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62588:65"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Faith and dependance on God, and expectation from him. He that comes unto God (and goes not away as he comes ſad from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) muſt believe that he is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him. It's the periphraſis that <hi>David</hi> deſcribes him by, <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of them that truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 17.7. In this hope and confidence the Prophet placeth mans bleſſedneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, whoſe hope the Lord is. The Lord is a buckler to them that truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 18.30. God is to his People whatſoever by faith they make him: Faith makes all that is in God a mans own; it engageth all Gods Attributes, and ſets them at work for his People; it obligeth him in point of honour to come in for their relief: Who will be found ſo unworthy as to fail them that truſt to him? If a friend truſt to us for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, counſel, aſſiſtance, we will by no means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him. Nay, if an enemy delivers himſelf up into our hands, and confides in us for ſecreſie, we will not be ſo diſingenuous as to betray him; much leſs will God ever prove unfaithful to us, while we are faithful to him. Faith calls in help from Heaven; it ſaith to God as the men of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> to <hi>Paul, Come over and help us.</hi> God is known in her Palaces to be a refuge. Our Fathers truſted in thee, and were not confounded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.5. Unbelief hinders eſtabliſhment, but Faith uſhers in proſperity. It's a riddle to Philoſophy to fetch ſtrength from another to undergo a burden; but Faith hath a ſecret vertue to fetch ſtrength from God, either as to doing good, or bearing evil. <hi>The Lord takes pleaſure in them that fear
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62588:65"/>him, that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11. <hi>He is a Sun and Shield to them that truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 84.12. Hope in him never makes the ſoul aſhamed. God never forſakes ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants (by faith) upon him: They that truſt in him, ſhall never become deſolate. <hi>David</hi> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this frequently in this book of Pſalms for help and protection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1. <hi>Be merciful to me, O God, for my ſoul truſteth in thee,</hi> Pſal. 86.2.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.1.</note> 
               <hi>O thou my God, ſave thy Servant that truſteth in thee.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.1. <hi>In thee, O Lord, do I put my truſt, let me never be put to confuſion.</hi> It's obſervable, that Gods being a rock and a refuge are joyned in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. God is his Peoples refuge which they fly to, their habitation they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually reſort to, and therefore he becomes their help. Though creatures are broken reeds, and crackt ciſterns, yet God was never a broken ſtaff, a dry and barren wilderneſs to his People. Now Gods children are not only an humble and a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a believing and depending people. As the child hangs on its Mothers breaſts; ſo do his children on their Fathers bowels. We finde holy <hi>David</hi> uſually profeſſing his confidence in his God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1. <hi>Truly my ſoul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my ſalvation.</hi> And ſo <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>My ſoul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. The Lord is my ſtrength, and therefore is become my ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 118.14. The People of God know his Name, and therefore will truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. They are a people who will not lie, by falſeneſs to their profeſſion and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or vain confidence in ſecond cauſes, or creature-comforts; a poor afflicted people, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62588:66"/>truſt in the Name of the Lord, that will not lie, nor do iniquity, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12, 13. The hypocrite leans on his houſe, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, his parts, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, profeſſion, common grace. The wicked man truſts in chariots and horſes, armies and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, his riches and revenues, power and carnal policies, ſhifts and devices, friends, wit, or wealth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. But what ſaith the pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ſoul? he breaths forth himſelf in <hi>David</hi>'s dialect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Some traſt in chariots and in horſes, but we will remember the Name of the Lord.</hi> A Saint leans only on the ſtaff of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he hath no other ſtring to the bow of his truſt, but God alone; he expects help no where, but from Heaven: <hi>Thou art my hope,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremiah) in the day of evil,</hi> Jer. 17.17. God is by right the confidence of the ends of the earth, but by act, the ſole dependance of his People. They truſt in him at all times, and pour forth their hearts before him. Even under the moſt diſmaying providences, which ſtrike amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into others hearts, and dejection into their countenances; yea, ſet the world into an uproar and combuſtion; under his skirt do their ſouls truſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Waiting and attendance upon him. Gods People are attendants at the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, alwaies waiting at the elbow of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As they are a praying, ſo a waiting people; when they have ſent out the Dove of prayer, they wait for her return with an Olive-branch in her mouth: when they have ſent forth the ſhip of ſupplication, they ſtand like Merchants on the ſhore, expecting her return, full fraught with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62588:66"/>heavenly treaſure. They wait upon the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and look toward him: They hearken and hear what God ſpeaks, having ſpoken, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Eccho, and diſpatcht their letters, look for an anſwer. Now eye hath not ſeen, no ear heard, nor can the heart of man conceive, what God hath prepared for them that wait for him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. God waits to be gracious to them that wait for hun, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. Such as wait on him, with ſubmiſſion and reſignation to his will and pleaſure, due reſpect to his glory, and patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution till he ſhews mercy, ſhall never loſe their labour. When <hi>Davids</hi> eyes attend his God, as the eyes of a Servant look to the hand of his Maſter, and a Maiden to the hand of her Miſtreſs, he is ſure of receiving ſome gift of mercy from hun, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2. When his ſoul waits for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning, the San of divine goodneſs will certainly riſe, break forth, and ſhine upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.6. God inclines to the ſoul that waits patiently for him; none ever waited on him in vain. Saints alwaies get ſomething by praying, but by waiting they gain double. The ſtill child ſhall have two breads. When the Church reſolves once to wait, God ſoon reſolves, ſhe ſhall wait no longer, but of an expectant, makes her an enjoyer, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7, 9. The Prince ſoon gives ear to the Favourite, who continues to give him attendance, and the Advocate delaies not to plead the Clients Cauſe, who will not away from his Chamber door, but determines to ply him with his over-eager ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations; yea, the longer it be, before the ſhip of faith and prayer returns, when it once comes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62588:67"/>home, it is the more richly laden, and brings him a double venture: The Church found it ſo, when ſhe came home top and top-gallant with her ſails of triumph, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> The needy ſhall not alwaies be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In reſpect of that incouragement in his ſervice, which he would have his receive from him, even againſt the wicked, who do not ſerve him. The Lord takes part with his People, and helps them againſt the world, that hate both him and them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.11. When moſt the object of mens envy and malignity, they have moſt of Gods love and affection: when out-caſts to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they are received into their Fathers arms. God would have the wicked diſcouraged in their way of rebellion, and his People incouraged in the way of duty. And by this they know he favours them, becauſe their enemies do not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.11. Did not God take in with his People, and ſtand by them, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed would triumph, and the Saints be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited and deſpondent: he aſſigns this therefore as the reaſon, why he would not contend for ever with them, leſt their adverſaries ſhould carry it ſtrangely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. and their ſpirits fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deſperate ſuccumbency, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16. Now when he pours contempt on their haughtineſs, and advances the poor on high from affliction, the righteous rejoyce, and all iniquity ſtops her mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.42. On which very account <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62588:67"/>ſolicits help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.26, 27, 29. that his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries might be cloathed with ſhame, and cover themſelves with their own confuſion as with a Mantle; while the righteous are glad in the Lord, and truſt in him, and all the upright in heart do glory. The Maſter ſometimes ſiniles on the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt and faithfull Servant, as to encourage him in his duty, ſo to diſcourage the negligent in his lazineſs; and the Prince ſhines on his Subject, as to countenance him in his loyalty and allegiance, ſo to diſhearten the Traitor in his Treaſon and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In regard of that juſt return and due improvement of his help, which he receives from them. They are thoſe alone who will praiſe and magnifie, extoll and lift up the Name of the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Being their ſtrength, he becomes their Song, and their Praiſe. Hear holy <hi>Jeremiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him upon this Experience. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.14. <hi>O Lord, my ſtrength, and my fortreſs, and my refuge in the day of affliction.</hi> And ſo our <hi>David</hi> before him. Pſal. 18.1. <hi>O Lord, my rock, my ſtrength, my fortreſs, and my deliverer, my God, my Buckler, the horn of my ſalvation, and my high Tower.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> before them both. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drowned, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> preſerved, he cants forth a moſt heavenly Doxology. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and ſong, and he is become my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an babitation, my Fathers God, and I will exalt him.</hi> What the Saints win by prayer, they alwayes wear by Thankfulneſs; what they receive in Mercy, they return in Duty. Where there is <hi>gratiarum decurſus,</hi> there is alſo <hi>gratiarum recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62588:68"/>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, and he will deal injuſtly: The ſhines of Mercy which draw out the fragrancy of the Saints graces, raiſe but a greater ſtench from the dunghill of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. They ſacrifice to their own Nets, and ſay, their own arm hath ſaved them. But the Church gives other language, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.3. <hi>Thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance; becauſe thou hadſt a favour to them.</hi> Let God grant the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance from the yoke of cruel and bloody Maſters, and give them free entertainment in his Service, they will wear the Livery of Joy and Gladneſs, and with their beſt Ornament of a gratefull Affection celebrate to future Poſterity the Anniverſary Solemnity of this good day of their deliverance. As Gods People go to him alone, and offer a ſin-offering in the day of their miſery and calamity, ſo they return to him only with a Peace-offering in the day of their mercy and comfort. They give unto the Lord the glory due to his Name, and what they want in outward expreſſion is abundantly ſupply'd in inward affection and admiration. He becomes their praiſe, becauſe he is their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, their boaſt and triumph all the day long: They make mention of his Name, and his Righteouſneſs, and that only. Neither do they with the prophane <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſing his Praiſes, and forget his works, but as they talk honourably, ſo they, and they alone walk worthy of his help, (and ſo in a comparative ſenſe may be ſaid to deſerve it.) They abuſe not the goodneſs of God (as wicked men do, who ſound all their Mercies upon their luſts, and ſacrifice them to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62588:68"/>their own ſenſuality;) but duely improve it, by ordering their Converſations aright; returning all the ſhines of mercy by reflections of obedience, doing juſtly, and walking humbly with their God; offering up themſelves back to him as a living, holy and acceptable ſacrifice, as their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>The Second follows, <hi>viz.</hi> The manner of its conveyance to his people.

Their Corn, Wine and Oyle are Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices thereunto.

This very conſideration both ſweetens and ſanctifies all Others Gardens are watered by the foot, as the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> was by the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> but they are watered from Heaven. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.11. The ſweet hony-dews of mercy drop into their mouths from Heaven, and while they open them wide, God fills them. This gives a ſweeter taſte, a better tenure (a title <hi>in Capite</hi>) creates a ſanctified uſe, and confirms to them their aſſurance of a ſupply: others may poſſibly, they certainly ſhall have help and comfort. So that the application of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial relation is a great advantage and fortiſication to Gods peoples Faith. And indeed ſo intended here. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here gives him this title, to perſwade us to a more firm dependance upon him, and lay us in with a ſurer ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than is to be had, or found in all things beſides either in Heaven, or Earth. And upon this very ſcore doth God uſually reveal himſelf by that Name, and his People ordinarily behold him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion, in Scripture. Not to multiply places, take one which may be <hi>inſtar omnium, Pſal.</hi> 20.1. where the Church thus accents her Benediction. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the Name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>defend thee.</hi> Where ſhe makes it a kinde of an Holy Spell to chaſe away all her Enemies, and expell her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. But ſo much for the firſt general branch of the words. The Thing imply'd.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:62588:69"/>
            <p>The Second follows, ſomething expreſſed, which is <hi>The Happineſs in having God for our Help.</hi> This is delivered poſitively, and alſo compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Poſitively and abſolutely, in it ſelf. And ſo therein are two things conſiderable. 1. A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictory Concluſion or Affirmation, a ſentence of bleſſing pronounced. <hi>Happy is he</hi>— 2. Its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation affixed or annexed, in the peculiar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation, expreſſed in the poſſeſſive <hi>His. His help</hi>— Here is the Saints great priviledge with their ſingular propriety. Their priviledge in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God as an Help: Their peculiarity in having him as their help.— To begin with the firſt. The Benediction affirmed. <hi>Happy is he</hi>— and that hints to us two Obſervations, one more general, the other more particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Saints happineſs lies only in God, in intereſt in him, in union and communion with him. God only is the certain ground, and infallible foundation of the Saints happineſs.</hi> Their bleſſedneſs lies not in having ſuch relations to men, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the World, but in their acquaintance with, and experience of God. The Pſalmiſt hath laid down an irrefragable Concluſion as to this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. <hi>ult.</hi> when he had given in an accompt of the Worlds value and Eſtimate as to Happineſs, or taken a ſurvey of the perfections of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their moſt promiſing looks of felicity, ſo as he cryes out, <hi>Happy are the People which are in ſuch a Caſe,</hi> having hopefull and beautifull Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, full Proviſions, ſecure Dwellings, by an holy Epanorthoſis he corrects himſelf, yea <hi>happy is that people</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62588:70"/>This is eternal life, happineſs in the beginning, and perfection too, to know God in Jeſus Chriſt. Happineſs is not bound up in the Creature, or the bundle of Creature-enjoyments, riches may ſerve for the owners hurt, and not for their good, and as they may render a man occaſionally ſinfull, ſo they may leave him finally miſerable. <hi>David</hi> beggs deliverance from ſuch a mercy (as a man in an agony, or at the brink of the pit of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>Deliver me from men whoſe portion is in this life,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. from their perſecutions, and alſo from their fruitions and enjoyments, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſequel of his ſupplication. There's no bleſſedneſs in having the World for our God, but in having the Lord for our God. A man may (with the Bee) wander from Flower to Flower, from one Creature-enjoyment to another, and yet finde no ſweetneſs or ſatisfaction. It's only ſafe bleſſing our ſelves in the God of Truth. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. Such as rejoyce in the World, rejoyce in a thing of nought. <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13. It's he alone that made us, who can make us happy, and that gave ſatisfaction for us, who can give ſatisfaction to us: And though we had never ſo large handfulls of the World, if we have not our hearts full of God and Chriſt, we are farr from true happineſs. Three things are requiſite for the compleating of true Felicity, the conjunction whereof is that which renders the Soul happy, and in the want whereof it muſt be found compleatly miſerable: <hi>Sufficiency</hi> and <hi>perfection, proportion,</hi> and <hi>perpetuity</hi> or <hi>duration;</hi> and theſe are only found to centre in God himſelf, who is God ſelf and all-ſufficient, the portion of his peoples Souls, and God from
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62588:70"/>everlaſting to everlaſting, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> who hath neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life, but is the ſame yeſterday, to day, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, and for ever. But this is only imply'd.—</p>
            <p>Secondly, and more particularly with reference to the chief ſcope and intendment of the Text, (as the notion of help ſpeaks a relation to the circumſtances of an evil time) a time of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affliction,) obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the ſupreme, yea ſole ground of comfort and confidence in an evil day (a day wherein a ſoul needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elp) is intereſt in God.</hi> O thrice happy is that Soul that in any day, eſpecially in a day of trouble and affliction, hath God for his Help. This was all the Muſick of <hi>Davids</hi> Joy, when on the top of the waters of diſtreſs, and outward diſconſolation. This was his ſole encouragement, that ſpake well to his Soul, when all things ſeemed to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquint on him, and be againſt him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. This was the only ſurviving hope of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the day of evil. This was the alone remaining prop of the Churches Conſolation in times of greateſt perſecution, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, <hi>Hub.</hi> 3. This was the ground of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations under all worldly diſturbances and commotions. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us, the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our reſuge,</hi> Pſal. 46.7. Now the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this point will appear, and be made good from a double conſideration: Both from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and alſo the manner, or the peculiar properties of that Help he affords his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Nature of God, who is his Peoples Helper. Now (amongſt many other) there are four or five things eſpecially conſiderable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62588:71"/>in God, which beſpeak the Saints happineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in him, in an evil day.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Infiniteneſs of his Being, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12, 13, 14, — 28, 29. — All his Attributes are equal, becauſe they are all infinite. Who hath limited the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or can confine him that is Eternity? <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching finde out God?</hi> Job 11.7. Though we may know him to ſalvation, who can know him to perfection? Creatures are all finite, though never ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but his underſtanding is infinite: His Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs, Truth and Mercy, all carry an infinity with them. He is not meaſurable by the line of humane reaſon, or fathomable by the plummet of any created un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but ſtill we muſt cry out, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and his waies paſt finding out?</hi> Rom. 11.33. He can do every thing, and no thought can be with-holden from him, <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. Men can do ſomething, but God can do all things; he is omniſcient, omnipotent, and omnidiſponent. Now all the wants and ſtraits of the creature are but finite, and <hi>inter finitum, &amp; infinitum nulla eſt proportio;</hi> there is no proportion between finite afflictions, and infinite compaſſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Abſoluteneſs and Independency of his actings. He doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in Heaven, or Earth, or all deep places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6. He ſits on the circle of the Heavens, and all the Inhabitants of the earth are but as ſo many Graſhoppers before him. All the Inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62588:71"/>according to his will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doſt thou? There is none <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, but God only: ſo miraculous is his providence, as he does great things paſt finding out; yea, and wonders without number, <hi>Job</hi> 9.10. All ſecond cauſes depend on him for their being, motion and operations, and in every ſtrait and exigency that befalls, muſt ſay as the King to the woman, <hi>Except the Lord helps, we cannot help.</hi> But though Heaven acts on <hi>haec inferiora,</hi> the firſt cauſe on the ſecond, it never goes to the ſecond, while that ever goes to the firſt. The ſpring depends not on the ſtream, though that depends on the fountain: All created beings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God, though he depends on no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated perfections; but for, through, and to him are all things. His own arm (when that of the creaturesis quite withered) can work ſalvation to him, and his righteouſneſs ſuſtain him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Immutability of his purpoſe and promiſes. He works all things according to the counſel of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn will. And his decrees iſſue forth as between mountains of braſs, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.1. His counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. If he decrees, who can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul? he cannot lie or repent, but will perform all he hath ſpoken, his whole word to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Tenderneſs of his bowels. He hath not only, a fulneſs, and riches of grace, but exerciſeth a freeneſs in his operations; and while creatures act according to deſert, he doth all from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62588:72"/>free grace, and hath abundance of compaſſions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which are never failing to his People. He i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Father of pities and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and they are all the genuine off-ſpring o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uncreated goodneſs. He hath the wiſdom of a Father, and the bowels of a Mother, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.15. Mercy is his darling, which pleaſeth him, <hi>Mica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 7.18. The <hi>Benjamin</hi> of his delight; he will not alwaies chide, nor be angry for ever. As a tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Shepherd carries his Lambs, ſo does he his People in his boſome: his bounty may be ſeen in his bowels, as in an Anatomy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, O Ephraim! — mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Eternity of his exiſtence. He is the eternity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the rock of ages, and God of all Generations. Creatures are but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and muſt ſhortly ſay to corruption, Thou art our Father, and to the worms, ye are our Brethren and Siſters: but his years have no end, and endure throughout all generations. He that builds on him, ſhall never be aſhamed, but have an everlaſting foundation. <hi>In the Lord Jehovah,</hi> (Iſa. 26.4.) <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> So that put all theſe together, and they muſt needs ſpeak his People happy in the worſt of times, whoſe help is laid on ſuch an infinite, immutable, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, compaſſionate, and eternal God, as their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It's demonſtrable from the manner of his ſupply and help. And ſo their happineſs in this their intereſt appears,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>A facultate,</hi> from his ability to help: he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62588:72"/>is the Mighty God, yea, the Almighty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 1. An able and ſelf-ſufficient, yea an Alſufficient God to his people; he hath pleonaſms of grace, and can do abundantly, yea, ſuperabundantly for his, above all they can ask or think, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. He hath not <hi>plenitudinem vaſis,</hi> but <hi>fontis;</hi> a fulneſs of redundancy, as well as of abundance. Does the ſoul want pardon, he can abundantly pardon; grace, he gives gifts even to the rebellious; comfort, he is the Father of mercies, and God of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. He knows our wants, yea and our thoughts long before; and when we know not what to ask, yet he knows what to give. He is able to help againſt ſin, its guilt, its ſtrength; againſt temptations, though Satan be mighty, he is Almighty, againſt afflictions from himſelf, or oppoſitions from the world. The ſhields of the earth are his, and he can weild them as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.9. His very <hi>intueri</hi> is <hi>operari,</hi> and one ſmile of his beatifical face, is able to create more ſollace, than all the frowns of the world can ſadneſs or diſcomfort. This was the pillar of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. Knowing, <hi>what he had promiſed, he was able to perform</hi> —</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>A voluntate.</hi> Men oft-times are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to help, but not able, and many times able, but not willing; but God is as willing as able. He is alwaies ready to ſuccour and relieve his People: he is a God that waits to be gracious; yea, he is already engaged, <hi>Call upon me, and I will anſwer thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ab inſtantia auxilii,</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentneſs and inſtancy of his help. He is a preſent help in time of trouble. Men oppreſſed oft miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62588:73"/>through help at a diſtance, but the Lord is alwaies near at hand to his people: he is their arm every morning, and in the evening the God of their life. <hi>God is in the midſt of her, and ſhe ſhall not be moved, God ſhall help her, and that right ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Pſal. 46.5. <hi>I am God, and not man, the holy one of Iſrael, in the midſt of thee,</hi> Hoſ. 11.9. He comes in the nick, ſeaſonably and opportunely, and brings ſalvation (if need be) on the wing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.5. <hi>As birds flying, ſo will the Lord of Hoſts defend Jeruſalem; defending alſo, he will deliver it; and paſſing over, he will preſerve it. Veni, vidi, vici,</hi> is his motto; he is ſlow to puniſhment, but quick to deliverance. <hi>Then thou ſhalt call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer, thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am,</hi> Iſa. 58.9. He is oft neareſt, when he ſeems furtheſt off. As he cuts ſhort his work in righteouſneſs, in reſpect of the wicked; ſo he brings near his righteouſneſs to his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.13. <hi>It ſhall not be far off, and his ſalvation ſhall not tarry</hi> —</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>A fidelitate,</hi> from his faithfulneſs in helping. The reaſon of mens failure, is either want of ability, or want of fidelity; but <hi>God is faithful who hath promiſed.</hi> By promiſing he hath made himſelf a debtor, and he will not ſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies engaged, much leſs break his promiſe. His faithfulneſs cannot fail. The husband may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the wife, the father to the ſon, the Prince to the ſubject; but God will never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to his People. Men may intend help, but be unexpectedly diſappointed, or pretend it, and yet really hinder; there is oft a conjunction of forces, where no union of hearts and affections.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62588:73"/>God made the woman to be a meet help to the man; and faithfulneſs is one of the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, A Saint, and he alone hath a ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in God.</hi> Others may have a common, but they only a ſaving intereſt. God may give the men of the world ſomething from himſelf, but he hath made himſelf only over to his People. They may call all their own but God, but theſe can call God theirs, when they have nothing elſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> portions, but reſerved <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> gave his other Sons gifts, but <hi>Jehoram</hi> the Kingdom. The earth God hath given to the children of men, but the Lord is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Peoples Inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence flows from intereſt, and intereſt flows on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from union. <hi>O God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) my God: Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee.</hi> He, who is the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is in him their God and Father. This new name none knows, but he that receives it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve, <hi>Saints only can be juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants of divine help and influence.</hi> His help and ſalvation is to them that fear him. Fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency on God flows only from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our intereſt in him, and is founded on this bottom, that he is a God in covenant with us. He is firſt the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then an help; that is the order here. My God, and then my ſalvation, <hi>Job</hi> 13.16. He is a peculiar help to his People. The title he hath aſſumed to himſelf, <hi>is the God of their ſalvation.</hi> Indeed he is an help to others in a larger ſenſe, but by way of peculiarity, or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62588:74"/>ſpecialty, the only help of his elect.

               </gap>ſtly hope, and confidently expect it. The wicked hath no hope. They alone can come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, and beg it in the time of their need. Wicked men have no God to go to, and how can they ever hope to come to God in an evil, who in a good day have run away from him? They alone will walk anſwerably to it, and therefore they only ſhall be the ſeats and ſubjects of it. The worldling indeed may have as large a ſail of confidence as a child of God hath, but he hath no good ballaſt of evidence: he may have a general hope in God as his God and Father, and ſo call him in prayer and by profeſſion; but <hi>dolus in generalibus:</hi> how can he be their Father, when they have not known him: <hi>David</hi>'s confidence is particular, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with good evidence, of faith in him, and love to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. <hi>Cui nomini natura nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, nomine deluditur.</hi> He that uſurps a title to God, without a conformity to his Image, is but over-born, and impoſed upon by a damnable preſumption, inſtead of a grounded perſwaſion. The Lord knows who are his, and he that names his name muſt depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>The third Propoſition is, <hi>That propriety in God is the only ground of true felicity.</hi> Happy is he

If a man walks over pleaſant Meadows, or in delightful Orchards and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and cannot ſay, they are his, he hath no content or comfort in them. If a ſoul ſhould run over all the Attributes of God, and the Promiſes of the Goſpel, and the ſufferings of his Saviour, and cannot write mine, they are a burden, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a bleſſing. Propriety and intereſt is the only certain ground of influence and mercy. The Promiſes (indeed) of the Goſpel are generally propounded, excluding none who ſhut not out themſelves by their unbelief; but withall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application is preſſed, that none might reſt in the naked notion, without peculiar appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: hanging on the outſide of the Promiſe will do us no more good, than did them their hanging
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62588:75"/>on the outſide of the Ark. The moſt ſoveraign Plaiſter heals not, if not applied; nor does the moſt delicious meat nouriſh, unleſs eaten and concocted. If ye eat my fleſh, and drink my blood, then ye have eternal life dwelling in you. Snatching at the Promiſe, without union with the Perſon, is altogether as unavailable to comfort the ſoul, as that phrenetick perſons challenge of all the ſhips that came to ſhore was to enrich him, when he had intereſt in none of them. Or as a Cheaters catch of an heireſſes writings is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to her eſtate, without marriage to her perſon. It's a good obſervation <hi>Bernard</hi> hath on that paſſage of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. <hi>With our ſoul in the night have we deſired thee</hi> — She ſaith not <hi>tua,</hi> but <hi>te.</hi> The gracious ſoul ſurrenders it ſelf up to God in a way of duty, ſaying, <hi>Lord, I am thine:</hi> and applieth God to himſelf in a way of mercy, crying out,, <hi>Lord, thou art mine.</hi> If <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Servants were counted by the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> happy in enjoying not ſo much his Court, as his company and preſence, then are the Saints much more to be eſteemed bleſſed, not ſo much in the fruition of the bare Promiſes, as in the viſion of their Fathers face in and through them. Bleſſed are they that dwell in his houſe, whoſe ſtrength is in him. Bleſſed are the people that hear the joyful ſound, that walk in the light of his countenance. The union between the King of Heaven and his Subjects, and holy confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the riſe of all their priviledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, <hi>They alone can expect help from God, that exerciſe in times of ſtrait and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62588:76"/>afflictions, a fiducial recumbency upon him.</hi> That is gathered from the phraſe or form of the words. <hi>Qui ponit in auxilium.</hi> There's a tacite condition annexed, placing our help in God; plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, That it's not the bare habit, but the act and exerciſe of faith, that entitles the ſoul to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help, and ſo makes a man bleſſed and happy in evil times, times of diſappointment or dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction, any trouble or affliction whatſoever. The Promiſe runs to the act of faith. As ye may finde it expreſſed to the life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord (who is my refuge) even the moſt high thy habitation</hi>— And indeed faith alone is that which makes uſe of Gods Attributes in time of diſtreſs. The habit of faith indeed intereſts in them, and makes them our own, but the exerciſe thereof draws them forth into act; that engageth God only in point of honour to come in for relief, even our firm dependance on him. What will all the treaſures of Gods Power, Wiſdom, Mercy and Goodneſs ſerve to enrich the the ſoul, if lockt up by unbelief? no more than a mans baggs, who never trades or imploys them. It's not intereſt, but uſe of God does the ſoul good. Indeed that delivers from eternal trouble, but this only ſupports under temporal. What good does a reſt or leaner do a man under his burden, if he never ſtaies himſelf on it? or a ſword or ſhield in a battel, if he never draws the one, or holds forth the other? or a ſanctuary and ſhelter in a ſtorm, if a man never runs to it, and houſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it? what benefit of a friend, if a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes uſe of him in his ſtrait? little or no ſweetneſs or conſolation is to be found in any thing
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62588:76"/>in God, his Attributes, Promiſes, or Providences, if we let them be dead and ruſt by us, and draw not out the vertue of them by faith. It's grace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed only, which pleaſeth God, and alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits us. If we do not <hi>recumbere,</hi> we muſt <hi>ſuccum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere. The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower,</hi> but only they which run to it are ſafe. And therefore the Prophet adviſeth this dependance on God as the only antidote againſt dedolency and deſperacy in dark conditions, and under ſad apprehenſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. Let him that ſits in darkneſs, and ſees no light, truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the abſolute conſideration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take a comparative view of it. For the Pſalmiſt having been eying of creature-helps and ſuccours, turns away his eyes from beholding vanity; by a ſudden Apoſtrophy looks wholly off the creature to God, and while engaged in that aſpect, he reſolutely and confidently oppoſeth his manutenence to all humane helps within view conſidered. And if we take notice of it in that oppoſition, or contradiction to thoſe objects wherein wicked men uſually place their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will ſuggeſt to us theſe two Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The excellency of God is much illuſtrated by the conſideration of the vanity of the creature. Theſe are Chryſtal-glaſſes, which ſet one againſt another, reflect a mutual light one to the other. The Word of God is a true proſpective, at the one end whereof, if we look, we ſhall ſee the world as a little mole-hill, at the other, God as a vaſt and great mountain: Indeed the glaſs of created
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62588:77"/>perfections repreſents God, (as the Moon do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the Sun) when they ſtand in conjunction with and ſubordination to him; (his inviſible glory and excellency is legible in the book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,) but they do but darken his beauty when ſtanding in oppoſition againſt him: And ſo do'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he theirs. The greater light extinguiſhes the leſs, <hi>Lord how ſoon did thoſe joyes vaniſh, when thou did i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rfection with a moſt orient and beautifull luſtre. As the ſight of our ſin appears moſt full in the glaſs of his purity and Holineſs; ſo that of our Vanity in the glaſs of his Fulneſs, and of our miſery in that of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs. Gods fulneſs and our emptineſs mutually illuſtrate one another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we obſerve the words as brought in by way of oppoſition or compariſon; ſo they ſpeak an excellency in the enjoyment of God above all Creatures, and a felicity in his Help above all humane help:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is imply'd a compariſon between God himſelf and the Creature, even the beſt of them, and ſo the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks him a God which hath a prelation and preheminence to all Creatures in their higheſt attainment and moſt glorious advances. The Souls happineſs in the enjoyment of God is ſuperexcellent and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to what is to be found, and had in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Saints enjoying God are more happy, bleſſed far above wicked men, who only enjoy the World: The one bears no proportion to the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62588:77"/>other. We find <hi>David</hi> making out the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between the Portions of his hand, and the Viſion of his Face, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.7. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14, 15. and how do's that caſt the ballance without all contradiction? <hi>Lord, lift up the light of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance— Thou haſt put more gladneſs into my heart— As for me, I will behold thy face in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs—</hi> The Kings favour is to be preferred beyond his gifts. <hi>Chryſantas</hi>'s Kiſs exceeds <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabarus</hi>'s golden Wedge. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>his love is better than Wine,</hi> Cant. 1.2. Curſed is he (ſaith that noble Convert) who preferrs not an hours communion with God before all the treaſures of the World. When as once <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth by his Herauld defied the King of <hi>France,</hi> under his multiplied titles, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile, Leon, Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> Arch-duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt returns his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge only with the repetition of <hi>France</hi> as oft as might anſwer his petty Principalities; intimating that one <hi>France</hi> was more valuable than them all. And do's not <hi>David</hi> oppoſe his Intereſt in God to all the World, when he had taken a full ſurvey of all its glittering glory and bravery, even to envy, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> — God was beyond, and infinitely better than Relations, Eſtates, Friends, Pleaſures, Honours, Life, Earth, yea Heaven it ſelf, than all in his refined and raiſed apprehenſions: <hi>Mallem in Gehenna eſſe cum te, quam in Coelo ſine te; Luther</hi> ſaith. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God alone is a real, ſolid and ſubſtantial good, in reſpect of whom all other are but falſe, counterfeit and deceitfull. <hi>Imaginaria in ſaeculo &amp;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62588:78"/>nihil veri,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The World it ſelf is like ſome perſons in it, empty, ſhallow-brain'd men, of a flaſhy, vapouring temper, the leſs ye know of them, the more ye value and eſteem them; acquaintance with them breeds ſlight and contempt of them: But the more we ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in whom there is a reall and infinite worth, the more excellency our Souls find in him, who is that <hi>Puteus inexhauſtus,</hi> never to be drawn dry by his Creatures; and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion we muſt ſay, not the one half hath been found by us. It's with the World as with a Picture, the greater diſtance we ſtand from it, the better it looks, but the nigher we draw to God, (as to a beautifull face, and native Complexion,) the more delectable and deſireable aſpect. There's alwayes upon tryal, leſs in the World, but more in God than we could expect and look for. God is a pure and refined good, from all the droſs and dreggs of imperfection and corruption which adheres to, or inheres in all Creatures. He is a full and ſatisfying good, the ultimate perfection to which all Creatures tend, and wherein all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires centre and find content and ſatisfaction. <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth. Nimis avarus animus, cui unicus non ſufficit Deus.</hi> Bernard. The Sun refreſhes without the Stars illumination. Had a man all the World in hand, his heart would not be at reſt, but (like the Needle toucht with the Load-ſtone, which is always moving towards the north point) would be inclining to God the firſt good, and utmoſt end. The enjoyment of God fills up all the chinks of a reaſonable Soul, and ſatisfies him alone in all wants, ſtraits, exigencies
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62588:78"/>and extremities, though he hath nothing of the Creature; but notwithſtanding the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or influence of worldly comforts, and Creature accommodations (which God never made or intended for the Souls ſatisfaction) in the midſt of its ſufficiency, it is in ſtraits, and tantalizeth under its greateſt fulneſs: All its fruition is but a golden dream of a Feaſt by one rockt aſleep on the bed of ſecurity and ſelf-deceit, which to him once awakened to right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſoon vaniſheth, and determines in a reall hunger. Many have been ſurfeited by the world, but none ſufficed, had too much to do their Souls good, but who almoſt ever ſaid, <hi>I have enough.</hi> To conclude this, (and dwell no longer on this firſt branch of the Text) God is (in a word) a durable and laſting, yea an everlaſting good, an enduring ſubſtance, a portion to his for ever. Creature-comforts are colours meerly wateriſh, which a little ſhower alters, but divine conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as colours laid in Oyl, which the greateſt ſtorm will not wear off, or fetch out. Creatures are all ſtanding Ponds, or crackt Ciſterns, ſoon dryed up; but God an ever-running and flowing Fountain; in whom there is (as the Father ſpeaks) <hi>ſerenitas ſine nube, ſatietas ſine labe, feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas ſine fine,</hi> Clearneſs without cloud, fulneſs without want, felicity without end. Yea, as his People are beſt at laſt to him, ſo is he to them: The World indeed is beſt at firſt, but God, at laſt ſweeteſt to the Soul. The firſt taſtes of God are exceeding delightfull, witneſs <hi>Solomons</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, when young, and in the prime of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The largeſt and longeſt draughts of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62588:79"/>World leave with them a tang of bitterneſs in the end, witneſs his <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> in the ſtrength of his Experience. The faſhion of this World and all things here below paſſeth away, and no wonder, for all created beings carry about them principles of ſelf-deſtruction, but God and his Word endure for ever.</p>
            <p>And as a Saints happineſs conſiſts in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God above all things beſides; ſo is it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by having intereſt in his help above all humane help and ſuccour whatſoever. And if we ſhould draw out the compariſon at length (which I ſhall not for fear of interfering, and too much enlarging) we ſhould finde there were indeed no compariſon; And that there were none holy as the Lord, none ſuch a rock as our God. There is a vaſt difference, and ſo tranſcendency of divine Help to humane, in reſpect of its abſoluteneſs and immediateneſs: All the help of Creatures is but mediate through the uſe of other Cauſes or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and but conditional on ſuppoſal of divine concurrence; <hi>If he withdraws not his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the proud Helpers do ſtoop under him,</hi> Job 9.13. All Creatures borrow their light from that Sun, derive their ſtrength from that Arm. Second cauſes cannot help without the concourſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the firſt; Men may pity, but the Lord only can help: But though they cannot help without him, he can work without them as well as by them. God and all the Creatures, is no more than God without any of them. All Creature-help is but ſecondary, but his is the prime and original. The help of Creatures is but particular and partial. Some men will aſſiſt ſome
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62588:79"/>perſons and ſome others; ſome will help their Friends, and others their Neighbours, or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, or take in with thoſe that ſtand, and are on the ſurer ground, and ſtronger ſide. But God helps all that call upon him, even thoſe which are fallen down, as well as thoſe that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Some things will help in ſome caſes, one thing in wants, another in ſickneſs, a third under dangers: but no one good thing is to be found in the World, that hath in it an univerſal vertue and efficacy: but God is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and his grace a catholique remedy under all trials and troubles, and can ſuccour under leſs afflictions, and alſo under greater; when the troubles of our heart are enlarged, he can enlarge the hand of his grace, and brings us out of all our diſtreſſes. Humane help oft-times is unconſtant and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the event. Men oft-times will not, oft-times cannot help, not the Warrier to Victory, or Magiſtrate to Right and Juſtice, becauſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by the number of enemies or offenders. and commonly fail, when we ſtand in greateſt neceſſity thereof: <hi>Vain is the help of Man,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; weak is their help. <hi>All the Nations of the Earth, are but as the drop of a Bucket, and the ſmall duſt of the ballance,</hi> Iſa. 40.15. God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Helpers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they ſhould all be deſtroyed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.8. and lie down in the grave with the uncircumciſed, <hi>cap.</hi> 32.21.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62588:80"/>both he that helpeth ſhall fall, and he that is holpen ſhall fall down, and they all ſhall fail together,</hi> Iſa. 31.3. But God is a ſure and impregnable Rock to his People. In fine, all humane help, as it is but arbitrary, (depending on the will of God, the higheſt cauſe of all things) ſo it is but temporary. Men and friends may ſtand by us, and help us till death, but they are mortal as well as we, and when either die, we are out of the reach of their help: A gulf is then fixed between us. None can redeem his Brother, no more than deliver his own ſoul from the hand of the grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. But God is our God even to death, yea in, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, even to all eternity, will never fail or forſake us, but guide us by his counſel, till he receives us to his glory.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have finiſhed the firſt general part of the Text, the comfortable propoſition or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A word or two of the ſecond general part, and ſo I ſhall cloſe all with ſome branches of practical application; which is the further explication or confirmation of the aſſertion. In theſe words, <hi>Whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> Wherein (to paſs the connection, which might give us this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>That he who would have God, or can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge him for his help, muſt make him his hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo the order of the words, deſcribing a godly man, firſt by his faith in making God his help, and then by his hope, which notes to us the conjunction of, with, or the priority or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of the grace of faith unto that of hope,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62588:80"/>and of believing to expecting. Faith is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Hope the Daughter; the ſoul firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and then hopes in the God of its ſalvation. In regard of the habit, as all other graces; ſo theſe are infuſed <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> being but one and the ſame caſt of that ſeed of God, which abides in us: And alſo in reſpect of their working and operation, they go hand in hand, they are as ſo many links of the ſame chain, knots in the ſame garden, all concatenated and indiſſolubly twiſted together; yea faith and hope, above all other, are of neareſt alliance, and cloſeſt companions. Hope is to Faith <hi>Fidus Achates,</hi> its faithful and conſtant friend: yet notwithſtanding there is a priority of order, both as to their being and acting, though none of time, faith being the primitive grace, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging the primogeniture in the ſoul, having both excellency of dignity, and of ſtrength: This tranſition of the Pſalmiſt only hints us the one to be <hi>pediſſequam</hi> to the other; where one goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the other follows, and faith is in the centre, hope in the circumference.</p>
            <p>But paſſing this, I ſhall take notice only of the matter, and therein conſider theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Saints character or deſcription: They are ſuch as hope in the Lord their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Saints charter of happineſs on that account, or their reward or remuneration; <hi>Happy are they</hi>— The firſt is the attribution of hope, as the diſtinguiſhing property, or peculiar ſpecification of Gods People in times of diſtreſs and affliction. And therein we have firſt, <hi>ſpei ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitium,</hi> the act or exerciſe of their hope.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62588:81"/>Secondly, <hi>ſpei fundamentum,</hi> the object, whereon their hope is founded, and whereby it is ſuſtained and ſupported. <hi>The Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The exerciſe of hope: That's the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the perſons. And ſo we may obſerve, <hi>Gods People are an hoping and expecting people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in evil times is their hope fixed and engaged on God. Thou art my hope,</hi> is their uſual language. Hope is the diſcriminating character of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. This the Saints have alwaies made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, and incouraged themſelves unto in the worſt of times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.5. Saith <hi>David, Thou art my hope, O Lord God.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.8. <hi>Mine eyes are to thee, O God the Lord, in thee is my truſt.</hi> So the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> It's the commendation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithful, <hi>that in hope he believed againſt hope,</hi> Rom. 4.18. Their ſouls depend wholly upon God, and their expectation is only from him. It's their differencing character from the wicked, who are men without hope, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Now hope upon a moral account is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a paſſion of the iraſcible appetite, about a future good, hard and difficult to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and yet poſſible, becauſe either promiſed, or proper to us. It's called future, to diſtinguiſh it from fruition, and alſo joy; <hi>For what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for?</hi> Rom. 8.24. Its object is alſo ſaid to be difficult, to diſtinguiſh it from deſire and anhelation, yet poſſible to oppoſe it to deſperation. Divine hope is no other than an aſſured looking for, and undoubted expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all promiſed good things to come, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62588:81"/>temporal and eternal, on the account of Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of the ſoul towards thoſe apprehended goods. Fear is converſant about evil, but hope about good. And as it bears a ſpecial reſpect to eternal bleſſedneſs, life and ſalvation, ſo a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and inferiour to all outward deliverances, mercies and comforts whatſoever. Faith conſiders things as true, hope as hard, though poſſible, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity as good. Faith looks at the word promiſing, hope at the thing promiſed. Faith and Patience properly reſpect afflictions, the one the ſtrength, the other the length of them; hope more ſtrictly the delation of mercies and bleſſings. The Saints often have little in hand, but they have much in hope. It's the Periphraſis of the Saints, ſuch as hope in the Lord. They truſt in him at all times, an a good day, a day of mercy, when their ſteps are anointed with butter and hony, while they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat the fineſt of the Wheat, and drink the pureſt blood of the Grape; and in the evil day, either of publick or private calamity, when God hedgeth up their waies with thorns, and writes bitter things againſt them; what time they are afraid, they truſt in him. They have <hi>ſpem in imis,</hi> and (though toſſed to and fro with the waves of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and diſcomfort) they can (with the wiſe Marriner) faſten the anchor of hope, both in the dark, and the deep, in the God of their ſalvation. They are alwaies cleaving to, and depending on God, addreſſing to him, waiting on, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting from him, looking and longing towards him; and though they want comfort and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet they alwaies nouriſh a ſecret hope, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62588:82"/>(though in a paſſion they may cry out, <hi>Their hope is periſhed from the Lord</hi>) yet as ſoon as the fit is over, they recollect themſelves, and ſay, <hi>Why are ye caſt down, our ſouls hope in God, for we ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The foundation of that hope is here expreſſed, <hi>The Lord their God.</hi> Where we muſt conſider the appellation, <hi>The Lord God,</hi> and the relation, <hi>The Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The appellation, <hi>The Lord God, Deus eſt nomen eſſentiae, Dominus poteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tis;</hi> the one is a name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting ſubſtance, the other power and authority.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve firſt, <hi>Though a Saint be never ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> happy in the influence of mercy, yet he ſtill keeps an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Having received a Kingdom, let us ſerve him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>If we call him</hi> (not Judge) but <hi>Father, let us paſs the time of our ſojourning in fear.</hi> God hath ſo tempered the diſcoveries of his greatneſs, with thoſe of his goodneſs, as there is matter for filial fear in the higheſt exerciſes of our faith and confidence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods power and greatneſs is a great incouragement of his Peoples hope in him. Not only his grace and mercy, but his power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is a ſtable prop of their ſaith and confidence. Outward greatneſs proves a diſadvantage to the improvement of worldly intereſts, and makes men ſtand at a diſtance, but doth no way hinder or impeach, but rather help forward divine intereſts and acceſſes. Without an intereſt in God, indeed the moſt comfortable Attributes are terrible, but through that, the moſt terrible Attributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come comfortable.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62588:82"/>
            <p>But to paſs theſe; thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>God, and God alone is the object of his Peoples hope in a day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

All his Promiſes are Yea and Amen, made in Chriſt, and confirmed, and made good by him. Now the Promiſes of mercy are ſure footing for our faith, and ſerve highly to fix and eſtabliſh our hope. <hi>I had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) in mine affliction, but that thy word was my hope,</hi> Pſal. 119.

Thou art my hiding-place, and my ſhield: I hope in thy word.</hi> And ſo emphatically again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait: And in his word do I hope.</hi> The Promiſes are as ſo many Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines for relief, Mines for ſupply, Springs for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, Breaſts for refreſhment: They are as the clefts of the Rock, and ſecret places of the ſtairs for the ſouls ſecurity and protection. They are as an anchor of hope, ſure and ſtedfaſt (as the Apoſtle elegantly calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19.) which if well faſtened, the ſhip is ſure; ſo that neither wind or wave can move it. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more venom in a judgement, than there is balm in a Promiſe. This was that bare up <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſoul, and Chriſt too whom he typifies, even Gods Promiſe of not leaving his ſoul in Hell,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62588:85"/>nor ſuffering his holy one to ſee corruption, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.35. This upheld <hi>Jonas</hi>'s ſpirit from ſinking under all his temptations and diſtractions, and his faith and hope from drowning, even when his body was ſwallowed up, he did not throw all over-board, but yet lookt towards his holy Temple, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. To which the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were peculiarly made. Though the gate of mercy ſeemed ſhut, all hopes of pardon cut off, mountains of oppoſition ſtood in the way of his faith, yet he looks up, and by faith over-looks all; faith in the Promiſe made him row againſt winde and tide, and bear againſt all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſaſters of providence, and hope not only againſt reaſon, but ſenſe too, and believe over not bare difficulties, but ſeeming impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities alſo. When <hi>David</hi> was driven out of all hopes of the Kingdom, ſo as peremptorily to conclude he was caſt out of Gods ſight, ſhould fall by the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> and all God had ſaid was but a ſtory, and his Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> a tale, a lie; he recovers himſelf from under all theſe wreſtlings, and animates his ſoul by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Promiſe; <hi>I had fainted but that I believed, to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living.</hi> Though God does not alwaies ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his threatnings, but revokes them on repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (wherefore the Jews counted not him a falſe Prophet that foretold Judgements, though they came not to paſs) yet he alwaies fulfils his Promiſes to them that fear him, and hope in his mercy. This ſtaid <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all apparent contradictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. He that promiſed would perform.</p>

Theſe will bear him up as in the dayes of old upon Eagles wings. I was under ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Lord ſtrengthened me, under ſuch an affliction, but God delivered me. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength, and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him, and I am helped:</hi> He goes to God by a Periphraſis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Shew thy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous loving-kindneſs, O thou that ſaveſt by thy right hand them which put their truſt in thee—</hi> And thus the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. and 44. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee— We have heard what thou didſt for our Fathers in the dayes of old. And ſhall not the Fathers unto the Children praiſe thy truth?</hi> So Pſal. 115.12. <hi>The Lord hath been mindfull of us, he will bleſs us—</hi> S. Pſal. 74.12. <hi>God is my King of old: Thou didſt divide the Sea by thy ſtrength, thou brakeſt the heads of the Dragons in the waters, Thou brakeſt the heads of Leviathan in pieces— Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord— Art not thou it, that hath cut</hi> Rahab, <hi>and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dragon—</hi> It's all along obſervable how the Church and People of God have ſtood upon this Giants ſhoulder of former experience in their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62588:87"/>pleadings and wreſtlings with him for future mercies. And in an eſpecial manner thoſe two ſolemn and ſignal deliverances, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from the red Sea: as God makes them a conſtant argument for obedience to him, ſo do they of confidence upon him. And thus the Church in the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> in the ſaddeſt dumps of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, recurrs to her experience, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It's good a man ſhould both quietly hope, and wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues againſt wants and neceſſities, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.5. from the Promiſe. And againſt dangers from the experiments of Providence. <hi>So that we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, The Lord is our belper:</hi> And ſo he reaſons againſt oppoſitions and perſecutions. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work—</hi> Former experiments (like herbs diſtilled in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which comfort the heart in the dead of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) may ſerve to juſtifie, yea to fortifie future expectances. It's good reckoning (though not from falſe and deceitfull man,) yet from the true and everliving God, what he hath been, that he will be to his People: He that hath delivered their ſouls from death, will deliver their eyes from tears, and their feet from falling; he that hath delivered, doth, and will deliver (as the Apoſtle concludes) even when perſecutions brake his back, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with this, they ſhould not break his neck, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. but God would make a way of eſcape. And ſo much for the Appellation, <hi>The Lord God—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Follows the appropriation, or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this to our ſelves. <hi>The Lord his God —
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62588:87"/>Our God.</hi> Intereſt in God is the only ſure ground of hope in him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>David encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Pſal. 60.4. <hi>Thou haſt given a banner to them that fear thee.</hi> The Signs of Gods favour and preſence, the aſſurances of victory and triumph are the Saints peculiar. God proclaims warr againſt the wicked: <hi>No peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> God will not caſt away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers; he will never take the wicked by the hand. His people only are the objects of his care and help in an evil day, as of his love and favour in a good. When <hi>he roars out of</hi> Sion, <hi>and utters his voice from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the Heavens and Earth ſhake, he will then be the hope of his people, and the ſtrength of the children of Iſrael,</hi> Joel 3.16. a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to, and harbour for them in the worſt of times, as the word imports. An Hypocrite hath no ſuch hope. <hi>The ſinners of</hi> Sion <hi>are afraid, fearfulneſs ſurprizeth the Hypocrites:</hi> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell with devouring fire, or endure ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. As 'tis the Saints duty, ſo 'tis their only Priviledge to hope. <hi>God, even our own God ſhall bleſs us,</hi> Pſal. 67.6. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation is the ground of Benediction: <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him;</hi> intereſt is the foundation of expectation. It was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Luther,</hi> A Chriſtians duty lies much in Adverbs, his comfort much in Pronouns. The Ship that is moſt richly laden with holineſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes may bear the faireſt Sails of confidence. Wicked men may be carnally confident, and ſeem to truſt in God, but all is but a pretence; they carry the faireſt ſide outward, and may have fair
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62588:88"/>weather in their faces, while a dreadfull ſtorm in their Conſciences. They may preſume, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, may lie to God, but cannot relie upon him. They who obey not Precepts, can never rightly hope in Promiſes, for where Faith is in the centre, Obedience will be in the circumference. Sin daſhes a mans hopes, and guilt enfeebles his ſpirit. That of <hi>Auſtin</hi> may be applyed here, <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene creditur vbi non bene vivitur.</hi> The flagg of Confidence that hangs outward in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is but a bare empty ſign, without an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved licence of holineſs, and will not allow him a drop of the wine of true Conſolation.</p>
            <p>But ſo much for the firſt particular, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Saints Hope, with its proper Object, <hi>the Lord their God.</hi> Now follows,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Praemium,</hi> the reward and retribution of this their hope, <hi>Happy are they:</hi> For the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Happineſs referrs to both Clauſes; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he to whom God affords help, and happy he that makes him his Help, by truſting to, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in him, — <hi>Whoſe hope is in the Lord his God.</hi> This is the ordinary Language of Sacred Writt, Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi> Pſal. 34.8. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſts in him.</hi> Pſal. 84.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> the Father, ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> the Son, that Maſter of the Sentences, affirms it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Whoſo truſteth in the Lord, happy is he:</hi> and ſo the Prophets aſſert this beatitude, which hope in God introduceth: Iſa. 30.18. <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait for him;</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this bleſſedneſs of the Soul by reaſon of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62588:88"/>its hoping in God will appear (not to name many things) and be evident upon this threefold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt. As it is a preſerver of the Soul from ſin, under trouble, as it is an antidote againſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the ſoul under trouble, and as it carries with it an aſſurance of deliverance and ſalvation out of trouble. Firſt, Under trouble it ſecures the ſoul from ſinning againſt God. That is the great matter of the godly's fear in time of ſtraits and afflictions, leſt they ſhould ſin againſt God: <hi>Nil timeo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to the Empereſs <hi>Eudoxia</hi> threatning of him, <hi>niſi peccatum.</hi> They fear to ſin by farr more than to ſuffer. Now (as a Mudd-wall choaks all the Cannon-bullets and Granado's ſhot againſt it, ſo do's this grace of Hope quench all the fiery darts of temptation. It's that preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, with which the Soul being well ſhodd, may walk over thorns and briars, and tread the Lion and Adder under his feet.</p>
            <p>There are three evils eſpecially to which a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul is liable under the burden and preſſure, of afflictions: Dedolency and deſpair under them, Diſcontent and impatience at them, or uſe of indirect and unlawfull Means to get: out of them, and theſe neceſſarily follow one another. Hope is a remedy againſt all.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Againſt male-content under trouble: It quiets, contents, and ſettles the Soul, and keeps it from murmuring and repining. This the Church found, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29. <hi>She put her mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there might be hope.</hi> They are deſperate wretches, who open their mouths wide, and blaſpheme God by reaſon of the Plagues, <hi>Revel.</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62588:89"/>16.21. Even the Devils blaſphemy ariſeth from their deſperacy. 'Twas the Atheiſtical King that would wait on the Lord no longer, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Hope waits untill the Lord is gracious, is dumb, and hath not a word to ſay againſt his doings. A deſperate Traitor curſes his Prince, but a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Malefactor, who hath the leaſt hope or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, willingly ſubmits to his ſentence. Indeed hope of mercy is a main ingredient in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and raiſeth it from Legal to Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, when a Soul ſorrows towards God, mourns looking on him pierced for as well as by him; and puts the rope about his neck, and ſackcloth about his loyns, in his approaches to the King of Heaven, becauſe he is a mercifull King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It keeps from deſpondency and utter ſuccumbency under affliction. It hath <hi>vim ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantem,</hi> a ſuſtaining power in it; bears a man up againſt his Infirmities; it keeps the Soul from fainting or ſinking: It's like the Cork of the Net, which keeps it up, when the Lead of Fear would pull it down, or the wing of the Bird, that mounts it to Heaven, while the ſtone tied to the legg forces it down to earth: But for Hope the heart would break: Now though mercy deferred may make the heart ſick, yet the deſire coming is a tree of life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. Good hope and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> commonly in conjunction. The Palm-trees motto is Hopes, <hi>Depreſſa Reſurgo.</hi> Believing is a choice and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Cordial, to preſerve the Soul from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From any unlawfull courſe to get out of affliction. <hi>He that believes, makes not haſte,</hi> Iſa.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62588:89"/>28.16. He will not leap over hedge and ditch, or finde any back-doors of eſcape, but wait till God opens a way of deliverance. The Souldier (though beſieged never ſo cloſe) will not deliver up the City, if he hath any hope of relief. The men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> were glad when <hi>Sauls</hi> meſſengers came and told them, <hi>To morrow by that time the Sun was hot they ſhould have help,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.9. Be the caſe never ſo ſad, the Soul will wait for Gods help, ſo long as it apprehends it ſelf not deſperate. Hope is not too haſty for or greedy of mercy, nor will not pluck the fruit thereof too ſoon, before it be full ripe. The patient (though brought never ſo low,) if in the hands of a wiſe Phyſician, ſtill hopes to recover, and is content, as knowing, the more deſperate and tedious his ſickneſs, the more will the joy be of his cure. The Captain though beaten by the Enemy, will by no means yield and take quarter, ſo long as he ſees any probability of fighting him; he is pleaſed with theſe thoughts, the ſharper the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62588:90"/>with a chain, than a Free-man without it. <hi>David,</hi> although heir apparent of the Kingdom by Gods Promiſe, and in great danger of miſſing it by <hi>Sauls</hi> violence, yet dare not make more haſte than good ſpeed, by making his death a ſtirrup to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the Throne by; nay, though he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, dare not take off his head for deſtruction, though for his conviction he cut off the lap of his garment; and that was <hi>animo renitente</hi> too; but rather waited Gods time of his advance to it, and ſettlement in it. The Primitive Chriſtians did not only, not ſeek or offer themſelves to a compoſition; no, but would not accept of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance on unworthy terms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. That's the firſt. Hope ſecures againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It doth admirably remedy affliction by ſanctifying and ſweetning of it. To name no more, it hath a four-fold energy in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, each of which hath a wonderful tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards the ſouls bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Vim quieſcentem,</hi> a calming and quieting vertue; it ſtills and ſedates the ſoul, and does <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos componere flucius.</hi> The ſoul is ſtill, when it once knows it is God, and his hand, and is no more diſquieted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. <hi>ult.</hi> It's filled with his peace, which paſſeth all underſtanding, <hi>&amp; tranquillo Deo, tranquillant omnia, &amp; ipſum quietum aſpicere eſt quieſcere:</hi> It gives not God an ill word, but holds its peace; nay, gives good words, bleſſeth his name, and ſaith, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord;</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. <hi>If I ſhall finde favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both the Ark and his habitation. But if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee: Behold,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62588:90"/>here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> It's reported of a precious ſtone called <hi>Bufonites,</hi> that caſt it into the Sea, and although it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo tempeſtuous, it will procure a calm. This precious grace is hope, which calms and ſettles the ſoul under its greateſt tumults and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtaies it under its moſt reſtleſs inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> tell us, that all the letters in the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> are <hi>literae quieſcentes.</hi> Faith and hope can perfectly ſpell this his reverend name, and out of every letter thereof gather a quickening lecture influential on the Chriſtian to compoſe him into a ſerene temper under the greateſt ruffles and diſcompoſures he meets with in the world. This lower Region is ſubject to ſtorms and tempeſts, but the upper Region is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and clear, no ſtorms above the Moon; and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians report, that they which are at the top of the Alps can behold great ſhowres fall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eath them, but not a drop above or upon them. Hope mounts the ſoul up to God, advanceth it to Heaven, and then 'tis out of the dint of every ſtorm, and reach of every tempeſt whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It hath <hi>vim ſublevantem,</hi> a ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuſtaining vertue. Faith and hope are (like <hi>Jachim</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> the Pillars of <hi>Solomons</hi>) the ſupport of the ſouls Temple. They are not only kept in perfect peace, but ſecurely too, whoſe minds are ſtayed on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3, 4. —<hi>The fear of man brings a ſnare, but whoſo truſteth in the Lord ſhall be ſafe,</hi> Prov. 29.25. He that confides in God, dwells in his holy mountain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.13. Is as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed. Mole-hills may be ſcattered, but Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62588:91"/>are immoveable. <hi>God is a buckler</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>to all that truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 18.30. The ſoul can never be caſt down that hath hope to lift it up. No ſooner <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance under a dejection, but hope gives it an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> erection and elevation. A ſecret hope will bear up the ſoul under the ſoreſt trials and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even though preſſed down above meaſure, ſo as to deſpair of life, yet this Pillar will ſhore it up from tottering and falling; as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vim conſolantem,</hi> a comforting power. It will not only quiet the ſoul, make it ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Lords ſalvation, and cauſe it to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in the fires, but rejoyce it alſo, give it muſick upon the waters, alwaies moſt raviſhing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> The Prophet having pronounced the bleſſedneſs of hoping in God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.8. illuſtrates it by the metaphor of Palms, or Lawrels, Myrtles and Olive-trees, which retain their greenneſs, and endure under the ſcorching heats of the Sun, and are alwaies flouriſhing and proſperous. God is a Sun for conſolation, as well as a ſhield for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them that truſt in him. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was glad, and his glory rejoyced, while his fleſh did reſt in hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9. The flower of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort grows on the tree of hope.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Vim confirmantem,</hi> an eſtabliſhing vertue: That fixes the ſoul on God, ſo as it does like a meteor hover in the air of uncertainties, but wholly acquieſces in him as his entire and reſolute
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62588:91"/>dependant, under all emergencies of providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7, 8. <hi>His heart is fixed truſting in the Lord, his heart is eſtal liſhed</hi>— Believing eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul, and keeps it, as from ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, ſo from unworthy deſpondencies, and doubting fluctuations, that it doth not reel to and fro like an houſe that wants a ſolid foundation, but is like the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> which (though it ſtands on the very Sea) <hi>nec fluctu, nec flatu movetur,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wind nor wave doth move it; neither is like the Willow ſhaken with every wind, but like the Oak, that abides its place in ſtorms and tempeſts. Hope in the Lord, is the anchor that faſtens the ſhip of the ſoul, ſo as it remains unſhaken and immoveable amidſt all the ſhakings of Satanical temptations, or worldly concuſſions. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwaies before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.</hi> The true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

The Earth may remove off its foundation, and the Mountains be hurled from their place, the Sea roar, and its waters be troubled, and yet the Church not be moved. Though weak in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vers are ſtrong in the Lord; and like the Boat (though wavering of it ſelf) yet tied to the Ship, it's ſure: Or like the Vine, Ivie, and Apricock; though ſome of the weakeſt of trees, yet leaning on the wall, and twining about the Oak, they ſtand firm and immoveable. A carnal man, or hypocrite, in time of diſtreſs, is ſoon moved, yea removed off his principles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, like a door that goes on its hinges, in a ſpiritual ſtorm, he becomes the ſport of every
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62588:92"/>wind and wave, but a believer gets up on God that impregnable Rock; and being <hi>homo quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> having his foot ſet for all aſſaies, bonds and afflictions, do not unhinge or unſettle him; nay, like a <hi>Paul,</hi> none of theſe things move him, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24. Faith upholds the ſoul, holds the head up above water, and keeps a man from ſinking; yea, were he caſt into a Sea of troubles, by this bladder would he ſwim to ſhore, being put under him by the everlaſting Arm of Omnipotency. The hoping ſoul ſtaies himſelf upon the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in truth and righteouſneſs; and though never ſo weak a creature in himſelf, and ſubject to fall, being ſupported by the ſtrong hand of invincible power, he ſtands firm and ſtedfaſt. Like the Spouſe coming out of the wilderneſs, and leaning upon the Arm of her Beloved, he reſts himſelf upon an Almighty Arm, ſo as 'tis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely eaſier to pluck the ſtrongeſt fabrick off its baſis and foundatiion, than to remove him off his hold on God his only ſtrength and ſupport; ſo that even the gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt him. Indeed the ſtrongeſt faith, and firmeſt hope may be exerciſed with variety of fears, doubts and temptations, but ſhall never be finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: Perfect love ſhall in the end caſt out fear, and this aguiſh and ſhaking ſpirit of bondage (of which a Chriſtian hath yet alwaies two well daies for one ill) at length give place to the more ſtable ſpirit of Adoption. That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It's a certain prognoſtick and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurer of mercy and deliverance. The ſoul that hopes well, ſhall have well. The only way to have a mercy, is to believe it. According to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62588:92"/>our faith, ſo is it to us. A wavering ſoul muſt expect nothing, but a believing ſoul may expect any thing from the Lord. Never did any ſoul periſh in a way of believing. Hope, though it may ſometimes meet with a delav, yet it never meets with a diſappointment. It's the glory of hope, not to make aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. They that wait on the Lord, never wait on him for nothing, but their expectations are crowned with anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſſes. I dare challenge all the world to give but one inſtance of a ſoul that was failed by God while he truſted in him. All that depart from him ſhall periſh, and that turn aſide to crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waies, be led forth with the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it's good to hold faſt to God. The end of faith is ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Such as truſt in God may be relict ſometimes indeed, but ſhall never be left deſolate. They may be ſometime diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, but never wholly deſtitute. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt having acted his faith and hope in God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently demands and challenges deliverance, wilt not thou O God — give us help from trouble? <hi>Pſal</hi> 108.12. Hope preſages mercy a coming. It laies a man under the Promiſe, and confirms his right and title to it. Now as a man, though he hath little in ready caſh, yet if a great deal in hills and bonds, is rich and wealthy: So the Chriſtian, though he hath never ſo little in hand, yet having all in hope and reverſion, is really bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy. The Promiſe runs, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> And therefore it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, that the Church in her petitions to God, begs for mercy proportionable to her hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.22. <hi>Let thy mercy (O Lord) be upon us,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62588:93"/>according as we hope in thee.</hi> Hope prepares the ſoul for deliverance. Whatſoever is received, is received according to the capacity of the receiver. Now hope enlargeth the heart, biggens and ſwells the deſires, dilates and expatiates all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the ſoul is no longer a narrow-neck'd veſſel, which cannot receive the full infuſions of mercy, but opens its mouth wide, ſo as God fills it. Whatſoever ye ask believing, ye ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly receive. They who travel with a big ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, commonly are delivered of a double bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And finally, hope laies hold on Gods ſtrength, and engages him to ſave and deliver, even becauſe the ſoul truſts in him. So that the ſtate of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, though never ſo ſad and diſconſolate, yet is never deſperate, but while he lives he may hope, yea, he lives, becauſe he doth hope. <hi>For we are ſaved by hope,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The ſinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may have a ſeemingly hopeful beginning, but he is ſure to meet with an hopeleſs, as well as to make a graceleſs end. His hope is like the Spiders web, when the beſome of death comes to give him his fatal ſweep, down goes his hope and himſelf together to Hells bottom. But <hi>the godly hath hope in his end,</hi> Jer. 31.17. Though what he hopes for may be long a coming, yet long-lookt for ſhall come at laſt, and be doubly welcome. The greater the travel, and ſorer the labour, the fairer and ſtronger the birth. And the longer the fruit of mercy hangs on the Promiſe, the fuller and ſweeter ſhall it be, when it comes once to fall into his lap, and drop into his mouth. The proſperous gales of faith and hope ſhall ſend home
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62588:93"/>the ſhip of his ſoul richly laden at laſt to the ſhore of Heaven, where he ſhall have a full ſatiety of that happineſs of which he had here but a ſlender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt; and be inebriated with thoſe rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that bubble up from the well head of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whereof here he had a more imperfect taſte, and of whoſe ſweetneſs and ſulneſs he was a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and languiſhing expectant. To conclude with <hi>David,</hi> (with whom we began) he ſhall then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Gods face in righteouſneſs, and be (abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly and eternally) ſatisfied with his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the opening the leaſes of the Text in its ſeveral doctrinal concluſions. Now what remains but to come and ſee, and taſte the fruit of this happineſs, in its proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branches of Application. And the Text is not a barren and dry Tree, but like the Tree of life, bearing all manner of fruit; yea, its leaves good for the healing of ſouls. Though we muſt but top the outmoſt branches, <hi>ipſa anal cia ſunt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſa,</hi> the filings of this gold are precious. And in the firſt place, by way of Inference, we may deduce from the conſideration of the promiſed Truths, theſe three Corolaries.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It preſents us with the different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and tranſcendent priviledge of the godly above all the world beſides. Here's a diſcovery,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of their different frame, temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſpirit. They have not received the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, but are men of another ſpirit; they hope in the Lord their God. As for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, it is not ſo, they are men without hope, either as 'tis a mercy, or a duty: they have no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62588:94"/>God to hope in, neither do they hope in the God they pretend to have. They truſt in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain riches, inſtead of truſting in the alſufficient and ever-living God: When they increaſe, and he grows full-handed, he ſets his heart on them. As in a day of fulneſs, he bleſſeth himſelf in them, inſtead of the God of Truth, rejoycing in the fleſh of his own arm, and concluding he hath gotten his wealth by his own hand and power: ſo in a day of want and emptineſs he placeth all his ſtrength and confidence in them: He goes not to God, but creatures, for his help; not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians, if he be ſick; not to the ſtore-houſe of divine Promiſes, but to the bag and granary, if he be in want; not to the great and ſoveraign Creator, but to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures, friends, relations, acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>intance, when once he comes to be forſaken; He leans on his houſe as the prop of his ſecurity. As in time of proſperity he offers ſacrifice to creature-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſaying, Theſe are the gods that have gone before us: ſo in time of affliction he bows down to them, and does them homage, crying out, Ariſe and ſave us. Is he under trouble of conſcience, it may be, with <hi>Cain,</hi> he goes to his muſick, his ſports and recreations, hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to dill the obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous noiſe of his own conſcience in the croud of outward enjoyments, or to ſmother its cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous voice in the tumult of his own diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affections. In time of outward perplexity, he flies to means, inſtruments, and ſecond cauſes, it may be to unlawful and indirect courſes, as <hi>Saul</hi> to a Witch, and <hi>Judas</hi> to a rope; becauſe there is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62588:94"/>not a God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he goes to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron. Aſhur</hi> (he ſaies) ſhall ſave us, and we will go down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ride on horſes. Like thoſe deſperate and diſtracted wretches, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19, — 21. They went to their Arts of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy, inſtead of the Living God, to Wizzards, Peepers, Mutterers, and ſuch as had familiar ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: And being hardly beſted and hungry, fretted themſelves, and curſed their King, and their God, and lookt upward: When reduced to a ſtate of neceſſity or diſtreſs, they grew ſo impatient, that like men in a phrenſie, or in ſhipwrack, or people ſtarved in a ſiege, or a woman in the ſore pangs of her travel, they make hideous out-cries, and in this forlorn, diſtreſſed, and diſtracted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are like people deſperate, and at their wits ends, knowing not whither to run, or what to do, or what courſe in the world to take, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an holy ſilence, and gracious poſſeſſion of their ſouls in patience under the load of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, like a boiling-pot, they ſend forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſcum and filth; or a burning mountain, evaporate continually the flames of their paſſion, and flaſhes of their indignation, in curſed and direful blaſphemies both againſt God and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Heaven and Earth together. So deſperate a caſe is every wicked man in in a diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And when death once comes and looks him in the face, then either he pleaſes himſelf with a falſe hope, and blind preſumption, which ends in death, founded on Gods mercy, Chriſts ſufferings, common grace, outward calling and profeſſion, immunity from ſome groſs ſins, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome external duties of the firſt or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62588:95"/>ſecond Table, or ſome ſuch like grounds (all too rotten and ſandy a foundation to build the ſtreſs of an immortal ſoul on for eternity) or elſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes deſperate and hopeleſs. This is the genuine temper of every ungodly perſon. But now on the contrary, what is the genius of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? He truſts and hopes in God, and in God alone. God is his ſong and his ſalvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.2. He truſts in Gods mercy, and his heart rejoyceth in his ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.5. In a good day, when he receives moſt from God, he attributes and aſcribes moſt, nay all to him. The hand of our God is upon us for good. Thou haſt given me power to get wealth — Yea, when he enjoyes moſt of God, he ſtill depends moſt on God: when he is ſurrounded with creature-comforts, and compaſſed with outward mercies even on every ſide, Gods Candle ſhines on his Tabernacle, his Mountain made moſt ſtrong, the lines fallen to him in pleaſant places, he waſheth his garments in Wine, and his cloaths in the blood of Grapes, yet he looks over and above all creatures as inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant cyphers, empty cyſterns, inſufficient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and comforts, to the Rock of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> truſting and confiding in him alone in his utmoſt weal, as well as in his greateſt want and woe, which is the moſt high, generous, and refined act of faith. Thus we finde holy <hi>David,</hi> when he had taken a ſurvey of the graſpings, gripings, and hoardings of the factors of this world, and of all their heaps and banks, he turns from them with an holy ſcorn, or rather zealous indignation, in the due aſcent of his heart to God, and anhelations after him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.7. <hi>And now
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62588:95"/>Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</hi> And ſo in an evil day, a day of adverſity, when, though a child of light, he walks in darkneſs, God follows him with breach upon breach, all his waves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs him, and his billows go over his ſoul; while his arrows ſtick faſt in his fleſh, and his hand preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him very ſore; while he ſows ſackcloth on his skin, and defiles his horn in the duſt: When all the ſongs of Sion are at an end, and he hath none but the ſad and mournful ditties left him of lamentation and woe; the joy of his heart is ceaſed, and he weeps ſore in the night, and hath none to comfort him; all his mercies, yea and his hopes are gone too, and periſhed from the Lord, and for peace he hath great bitterneſs; yet then he mounts up (as on Eagles wings) by fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial acts to Heaven, and ſaith, Lord, though I know not what to do, yet mine eyes are towards thee. He ſtill remembers the years of the right hand of the moſt High. He may meet with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but never fall into diſtraction; perplexity, but not paſſion or perturbations. Though he be troubled on every ſide, yet he is not diſtreſſed, though perplexed, yet not in deſpair, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, yet not forſaken, though caſt down, yet not deſtroyed; as the Apoſtle triumphs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. — He may be at his wits end, but never at his faiths end. Though his faith wants wings to flie, yet it hath a foot to go, or at leaſt a knee to creep. He yet dwells in the ſecret of the moſt High, though he hath no corner to lay his head in here below, he caſts his burden upon the Lord, when he findes his own ſhoulders too weak to bear under it, and commits his way to him,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62588:96"/>to bring it for him to paſs, when ſo dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate as he cannot finde the leaſt path out of it: He caſts his care on him, who taketh care for him. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And as this gives us an account of the different temper, ſo likewiſe of the different happineſs of the Saints above all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. He not only hopes in the Lord, but hath the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> for his help. While we ſtand on the turret of this comfortable doctrine, and take a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-view of the godly's felicity, we may cry out of them, as <hi>Baalam</hi> ſtanding upon Mount <hi>Peor</hi> once did of <hi>Iſrael. How goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles, O Iſrael!</hi> O thrice happy and unſpeakably bleſſed ſouls that have this intereſt in God. Happy are they indeed, who are in ſuch a caſe. There are four choice privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which flow from the ſouls intereſt in God, each whereof is an Herauld to proclaim to all the world his felicity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, holy peace and ſerenity, tranquillity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence and ſatisfaction. <hi>I will lay me down in peace, and ſleep, becauſe thou (O Lord) only keepeſt me in ſafety.</hi> There may be trouble and turmoil abroad, but alwaies peace at home; ſtorms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but a calm within. The peace of God is the Chriſtians Life-guard. <hi>In the world they may have tribulation, but in him they have peace,</hi> John 16. <hi>ult.</hi> —</p>
            <p>Secondly, A grounded certainty as to enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for God never diſappoints them who truſt in him. The mercies he gives his People, (though ſlow in coming) are ſure mercies; <hi>The ſure mercies of David.</hi> The Covenant he hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62588:96"/>made is everlaſting and ſure. The promiſe both of Spirituals and Temporals being of Faith is ſure to the ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. It was part of <hi>Moſes</hi> bleſſing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.28. <hi>Iſrael ſhall dwell in ſafety alone, the fountain of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall be on a Land of Corn and Wine: alſo his Heavens ſhall drop down dew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, An undoubted ſecurity. As certainty of mercies, ſo ſecurity from evils and miſchiefs is their portion. They are ſecure from Treachery at home, for no fear of Apoſtacy to him who hath God as his Help: He ſhall overcome, and be made a Pillar in the Houſe of his God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.12. And ſecure from Foreign Violence. For if God be on his ſide, who dare engage on the contrary? He may ſing with <hi>David</hi> in that heavenly Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of his, <hi>The Lord is my light, and ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? I will not fear what man can do unto me; No, not of ten thouſand which have round beſet me.</hi> God is a ſure defence to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>Benjamin the beloved of the Lord ſhall dwell between his ſhoulders,</hi> Deut. 33.12. The Enemy may thruſt ſore at him (as a man againſt an Houſe ſide) but the Lord helps him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13. Gods protection is a Pillar to ſhore him up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every blaſt of the adverſary to overturn him. A Saint being inchanted (as I may ſo ſpeak) with the Name of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> is ſhot-free, ſecure from gun-ſhot, out of the reach of all dangers, enemies, evils, and afflictions whatever.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Supply or ſufficiency, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.5. <hi>He that truſteth in the Lord, ſhall be made fat.</hi> He that hath God, hath all in him engaged for his good. <hi>Son, I am thine, and all I have is thine;</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62588:97"/>ſaith God to his Children. What power, wiſdom, mercy, or any other excellency is in God, is active for his peoples good; yea all Creatures in Heaven and Earth, are at their command and ſervice. And we may well cloſe this Uſe with that of <hi>Bernard, Si Deus tam bonus quaerentilus, quam lonus fruentibus?</hi> If God be ſo good to them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ction, or rather in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the infelicity of ſinners; As the doctrin puts a cup of Conſolation into the hand of the godly, ſo of Trembling into the hands of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; beſpeaks by way of terror, and convinceth of the ſad miſery, and grand unhappineſs of all that want, and are ſtrangers to an Intereſt in God. In a good day they have no ground of comfort, and in an evil, no aſſurance of help. That's the ſecond practical Inference.</p>
            <p>It they be happy who have this title to God, and bleſſed, certainly they muſt needs be curſed and miſerable that are without it, unleſs they had any thing equivalent with it, which is impoſſible. O ſad and dreadful condition, to be at once both hopeleſs and helpleſs: This is the utmoſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of unhappineſs, the deſperate condition of the Devils and damned in Hell. Such as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62588:97"/>God, are without hope, yea without both hope and help. And ſhould a man ſpeak a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words, he could not more fully expreſs the diſmal complexion of any ſtate, than is done in this one, <hi>To be hopeleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wicked have no Heaven hereafter, no hope here An ungodly man may run and read his condition in the glaſs of this point, who hath no God to go to, he hath not the leaſt ground or colour of hope, but continually occaſion of fear, and perpetual cauſe of terror. He hath no juſt hope in the day of Mercy, and that's ſad enough, much leſs in the day of miſery, and that's worſe. His defence is departed from him, the Lord being not with him, and he is bread for the teeth of every Judgement, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> told them of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were to invade, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. In the day of abounding of all Creature-comforts, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man can have no content or ſatisfaction: One thought of his diſtance from God will ſufficiently imbitter all his Cups of pleaſure, ſo as they ſhall be no other than waters of <hi>Marah</hi> to him. Under the tydes of external Joy his heart is ſorrowfull, and his brighteſt Sun of outward felicity hath ſad reflections, eſpecially if the Clock of Conſcience anſwers the Diall of the Word, and amidſt his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62588:98"/>or relief, either from within, or from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the day of affliction. As fear of loſing eats up all his comfort and content in enjoying, ſo forfeiture of title makes his loſt Soul eternally deſpair of a recovery and repoſſeſſion. I wonder on what acquaintance the ſinner can challenge any intereſt, or pretend to any hope in God, or what poſſible ſhould be the ground-work and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his profeſſed, but miſtaken confidence? He may build Caſtles in the Air, and make to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a refuge of lies, pleaſe himſelf with conceits and fancies of ſuppoſed and imaginary happineſs, but they will prove meer deluſions in the end. As his confidence is a lie in the foundation, ſo it will be in the event, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.

If God once forſakes him all the world cannot help or relieve him: Neither any of the Perſons, nor all the things of the World can give him comfort. If the Lord helps not, who can help?

The depth would ſay, it is not in me; and the Sea, it is not in me— All creatures would be found mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable comforters, Phyſitians of no value. <hi>I have ſeen an end</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) of all perfection.</hi> The total of all creatures in their natures improved and advanced, and their quinteſſence extracted and refined, amounts but to this, <hi>Vanity of vanities.</hi> But in God there is enough to make the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably and eternally bleſſed. There is in him a ſufficiency to ſupply all the wants, and anſwer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll the demands and cravings of the ſoul of man. <hi>In his preſence is fulneſs of joy.</hi> He can ſupport their hearts when weakeſt, and ſupply them when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mptieſt: he can remove whatſoever threatneth the ſouls deſtruction, and confer whatever tends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o its, perfection. It was <hi>Davids</hi> concluſion of faith, when the Lord was his Shepherd, that he ſhould never want. God is a comprehenſive good, containing all that vertue and influence eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in himſelf, which is in the creatures formally.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62588:101"/>He can fill the ſoul, and yet never cloy it; give it a fulneſs, and yet no burden. The world delights nothing but in change and variety. The moſt choice meats, if common, prove nauſeous; and delightful muſicks, if conſtant, tedious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome. But <hi>in unico Deo,</hi> is all the heart can deſire or wiſh, and the conſtant enjoyment of him is Heaven to the ſoul, without any the leaſt glut or diſreliſh. There is a ſuitability in him to the ſouls of his People. He is the centre of all their deſires. And the degree of their ſatisfaction ariſeth as from the degree of their union with him, ſo the degree of his proportion to them. He is an adequate and commenſurate good to the deſires and hopes of a gracious ſoul. There is an exact agreement between his ſweetneſs, and the ſouls taſte, which creates a moſt ſavoury reliſh of him in the ſouls palate. God alone being the higheſt object of faith, is the greateſt ground of joy and ſatisfaction. And ſuch a ſuitableneſs is in him to the ſoul, that it deſires nothing like, nothing but himſelf. Heaven it ſelf would be but Hell without him. The Kings preſence is that makes the Court. A Saint is more pleaſed with the enjoyment of God, than of Heaven, glory, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf. He is his Peoples ſalvation. As no ſacrifices content God which his People offer him without the oblation of themſelves; ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all his donations delights his People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he beſtows himſelf as a Legacy upon them. And then his Eternity in his being, and fidelity in his Promiſes is a great aggravation of his Peoples happineſs, as well as his own excellency. It's the main ſcope of the Pſalmiſt in theſe verſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62588:101"/>God to us, and repreſent him as a fit object of our faith, and aſſured ground of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs from his truth and faithfulneſs. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they are all unſatisfying, like drink in a dropſie, that is ſo far from quenching our thirſt, that it rather enflames it; ſo likewiſe deceitful, like <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Mule running from under us, when we have moſt need of their ſtay, and Halcyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds that abide with us in Summer, but when Winter once comes, are upon the wing, and gone. But God is the faithful and living God, whoſe truth never fails, mind never changes, good will never abates towards his People. He may change his outward diſpenſations, but not his inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Non deſerit, etiamſi deſerere videatur:</hi> We may loſe our viſion of, and influence from him, but never our union and communion with him. He may for a time deſert us, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagate from him, but will never utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit us, and caſt us out of his favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but though for a moment he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes, with everlaſting kindneſs he remembers us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This teacheth us the folly and danger of all oppoſitions againſt, and oppreſſions of the People of God. If God be their help, who ſhall be their deſtroyer, or dare be their oppoſer? And yet ſuch is the madneſs and phrenſie of the world, as they will venture to ſet themſelves againſt thoſe God hath ſet himſelf for. The wicked have ſhamed the counſel of the poor, becauſe the Lord is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. They know what to do well enough with him for all that, they are reſolved to perſecute him, let him ſave and deliver him. <hi>Many there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62588:102"/>be</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) which ſay of my ſoul, there is no help for him in his God,</hi> Pſal. 3.2, 3. Theſe in their triumphant bravado's, and flouriſhing vapours are their vain and curſed concluſions; I will purſue, I will overtake, that's their deſperate reſolution. The world is reſolved to hate thoſe God loves, and perſecute them God hath undertaken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect. They will kick againſt the pricks, and though they cannot reach the perſon (Chriſt, whoſe Image the Saints do but repreſent) yet <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>-like in their rage, they will tear the picture: Either by ſecret fraud they are conſulting againſt Gods hidden ones, to undermine them, or by open violence endeavouring to overthrow them. But ſuch is the Saints ſtability in God, that the very gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt them. They are as Mount Sion that cannot be moved. They do but throw ſtones againſt the wind, go about to pluck the Sun out of Heaven (as thoſe <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, who when ſcorched by the heat of it, endeavour with their arrows to ſhoot at it.) There is no enchantment againſt <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> nor divination againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baalam</hi> himſelf a Wizzard, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. And God hath ſet a <hi>noli me tangere</hi> about his People, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. Yea promiſed, <hi>that no weapon formed againſt them ſhall proſper.</hi> God will turn thoſe weapons againſt themſelves, and cauſe all their arrows to return on their own heads. God will be an enemy to his Peoples enemies, and bring ruin on all the Churches oppreſſors. It's <hi>Solomon</hi>'s counſel not to oppreſs the poor, becauſe his Redeemer is mighty. The Moſt High regards it, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it too, and relieve them under it. For the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62588:102"/>oppreſſion of his poor and needy he will alſo ariſe, and ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12.5. God is his Peoples ſecond, and ſtands at their back; he will uphold <hi>Jacob,</hi> though a Worm; he hath undertaken their defence, and will vindicate their cauſe. They therefore have no cauſe to fear, or their enemies to triumph. God ſtands Sentinel over them, never ſlumbers or ſleeps, and they may ſleep ſecurely, while he awakes; as that great Commander did when his Captain was watching the enemies motion. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> will never flie, or run for't, as long as he hath God for his ſhield, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.1. <hi>In the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>put I my truſt: how ſay ye to my ſoul, fly as a Bird to your Mountain?</hi> And neither have their enemies any ground of confidence. Would not you think that man worſe than mad, whom you bend ſetting his ſhoulders againſt a ſtrong and well-built houſe, thinking to overturn it of its foundation, or againſt an impregnable Rock, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to remove it from its place? Such and infinitely far worſe is their vanity, who ſet themſelves againſt the Lord and his Anointed. None ever yet ſet himſelf againſt the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſhall ever do, but will be ſure to have the worſt of it. God ſaies, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.3. <hi>He will make Jeruſalem a burthenſome ſtone for all people: all that burden themſelves with it, ſhall be cut in pieces. Heerom</hi> tells us, that at the entrance of the gate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there lay very great ſtones, by the lifting whereof men uſed to try their ſtrength: He that could heave them came off without any harm, but they which attempted, and could not lift them, were ſorely bruiſed and battered, if not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62588:103"/>utterly ſpoiled by them. Such will be the iſſue and ſucceſs of all wicked mens deſigns and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes againſt Gods People, who have him as the ſtone of their help, all their powers, policies, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and under-ground devices ſhall come to nought and confuſion, their miſchief come down on their own head, and their violent dealing on their own pate; yea, all their conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>deracies and combinations as well as conſpiracies, and ſecret machinations ſhall be broken in pieces, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10. And as God told the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> once when leaning on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> both he that helpeth, and he that is holpen ſhall both fall together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. — O that the world would at length learn the wiſdom not to oppoſe God, and ſo run on the pikes of their own inevitable ruin; but rather kiſs the Son, leſt they periſh in his wrath when kindled but a little — And (which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, or rather a juſt inference upon it) let all that pretend to bear good will to Sion, beware openly or covertly of taking in againſt Gods intereſt and cauſe, whatſoever be their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes or pretences, leſt it comes home by them in the end. If <hi>Meroz</hi> was curſed for not helping the Lord againſt the mighty, what will be their doom, who dare help the mighty againſt the Lord? If good <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> had ſo ſharp a reproof for helping with the ungodly, and thoſe who did not fear the Lord (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2.) They muſt needs not only be blamed, but alſo curſed, who will venture to aid, abet or aſſiſt the wicked againſt thoſe who fear the Lord, and are the objects of his help and protection — And ſo much by way of deduction and inference.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62588:103"/>
            <p>Secondly, This provokes to examination. If they be thus happy who are intereſted in God, and have him as their help and hope, it's worth our enquiry, whether this God be our God, and conſequently our help and hope in the day of evil. Now, if we would know this our intereſt, let us take firſt ſome general ſigns of an intereſt in him: Secondly, ſome more particular evidences or diſcoveries of our making him our hope and help. —</p>
            <p>The firſt mark or ſign of an intereſt in God, is union with him in and through Chriſt. All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (through the fall) are out of favour at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there is no coming to God but through his Son, <hi>He is the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> The way in which, the truth by which, the life unto which the ſoul moves and comes. No man comes to the Father, but by him, nor knows the Father, but 'tis of his revealing. We are far off from God by nature, but draw nigh through Chriſts blood, that new and living way — If we know him, we know alſo the Father. Are our ſouls united then to Chriſt by faith? have we received him as our Lord and Saviour, Prince and Prieſt, to ſave and ſanctifie, redeem and rule us? are we joyned to him by the ſame ſpirit? does he dwell in our hearts by faith? is he in us, and we in him, and abides in us as the hope of our glory? our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him is a ſure and infallible evidence of our intereſt in the Father. He is the only <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder whereby we can climb up to communion with the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> His foot is on Earth, but his top in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is our covenant obligation to him.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62588:104"/>
               <hi>I entred into a covenant with thee</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. Iſa. 55.3. There is a mutual covenant between God and his People: as he hath engaged for their ſalvation, ſo have they for his ſervice. <hi>O Lord, I am thy Servant,</hi> (quoth <hi>David</hi>) and ſo the Church, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.5. <hi>For all people will walk every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.</hi> She gives up her ſelf to God, not only in a way of ſingle conſidence, but reſolute obedience. The relations are mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his People; he becomes theirs, and they his. They are betrothed (in the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant) to him in judgement, righteouſneſs, tender mercies, and faithfulneſs, and they know the Lord. Art thou then, O ſoul, brought into covenant with God? haſt thou broken off that accurſed league with ſin and Satan, by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and engaged thy ſoul ſolemnly to become a faithful ſervant to him as thy only Liege-Lord, and no other? Art thou reſolved to fear, love and ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the daies of thy life, and to glorifie him in thy ſoul, body and ſpirit which are his? Thy engagement for his glory, is an hopeful ſign of his engagement for thy good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Intimate acquaintance, and indeared communion with him. <hi>Abraham</hi> had great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, and as great acquaintance with him. We may ſee in <hi>Sodoms</hi> caſe, how boldly he goes to him. Friendſhip with God breeds an holy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. So <hi>Moſes</hi> had a large ſhare in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and God ſpake to him face to face, and he talked with him again as a man with his familiar
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62588:104"/>friend. There are ſweet communications of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel between God and a gracious ſoul. <hi>Our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is with the Father</hi>— 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, and had intimate acquaintance with God, went to him by faith and prayer on all occaſions. <hi>It's good for me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to draw near to God;</hi> and <hi>one daies communion with him, is worth a thouſand.</hi> It was ſaid of <hi>Charls</hi> the great, he converſed more with God than men. As all communion is founded in union, ſo true union diſcovers it ſelf by flowing forth in acts of communion. Now, Chriſtian, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion maintains thy ſoul with God in prayer, private, ſecret, in meditation, in publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? Is it thy meat and drink, thy joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, to work righteouſneſs, and meet him in his waies? Thou canſt have no intereſt in God, if thou liveſt without him in the world, nor canſt call him Father truly, if thou haſt not, or doſt not know him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Sympathy and fellowſhip with him. Gods intereſt and the ſouls are not two, but one; they are like two Turtles, if one dies, the other never lives comfortably after, but ſorrowing for the loſs of her Mate. God is ſenſible of, and well-pleaſed with all the good done to his People, his language is, <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it to theſe, ye have done it to me.</hi> And his people are affected with, and rejoyce in all the glory is brought to him; and had rather loſe their comfort, than their God ſhould loſe his honour: They deſire he alone ſhould be magnified, and are willing to be made ſtirrups for him to riſe by, though it be by their utter downfall. And as they are ſatisfied in each
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62588:105"/>others good, ſo ſenſible of each others evil. God ſympathizeth with his Peoples ſufferings; <hi>In all their afflictions he is afflicted.</hi> And they with his affronts and injuries. The intereſt of God lies nearer their hearts than any thing elſe in the world. They count not their own lives dear, ſo they may but ſave his honour, and ſo he be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; though they be reproached, impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, impriſoned, bamſhed, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſecuted, they think themſelves well apaid: What ſympathy haſt thou with Gods cauſe and intereſt? doſt thou account the glory brought to him, as good done to thee? and take the injuries he ſuffers as offered to thy ſelf? Canſt thou wiſh thy ſelf a ſhield to ſence off thoſe diſhonours which are caſt on the face of thy Lord and Maſter? Art thou meek as a Lamb in thy own cauſe, but fierce as a Lion in Gods, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> how art thou affected when thou heareſt his holy Name torn by the black mouths of the wicked, and their tongues ſet on fire from Hell? when thou ſeeſt his Creatures abuſed, his Ordinances prophaned, his People trampled under foot, his Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, his Attributes blaſphemed, his Sabbaths unhallowed, his Worſhip polluted? If thou beeſt in the relation of a Son, thou wilt not endure to ſee one ſpit on thy Fathers face; or an ingenuous Servant, wilt not bear thy Maſters wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Suitable affections. Where there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, all the affections of the ſoul have their out-goings after him. Thou haſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, An high eſteem and valuation of him. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> Intereſt raiſeth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62588:105"/>eſtimation. The Father eſteems his Child, and the Husband his Wife, and ſo <hi>vice verſà,</hi> above all other, though they be deformed, and others beautiful; they weak, and others healthful; they rich, and others poor; they ignorant, and others learned and knowing, becauſe of their propriety in them. A Saint values God above all the world, above all things viſible or inviſible; counts all loſs, droſs, and dung in compariſon of him. He alone is to him the Pearl of true price. Gods People are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him above all others, and ſo is he to them likewiſe. They will part with all for him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him before all, and venture all rather than loſe their hold of him, or ſacrifice their intereſt in him, <hi>omnia levia preterquam quod tui carendum</hi>—How ſtands their eſteem poiſed?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou haſt an ardent and affectionate love towards him. <hi>I will love the Lord my ſtrength,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.1. Self-intereſt makes a man love his own. <hi>Whom believing we love.</hi> The applications of faith are alwaies ſeconded with the imbraces of love. He that hath God for his God, hath had experience of his love in Chriſt, ſome taſtes of his love ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt; and he cannot but love him by whom he was firſt loved. This love conſtrains him, <hi>Amor meus Pondus meum</hi>— Does mercy love miſery, and ſhall not miſery love mercy? beauty affect deformity, and ſhall not deformity re-affect beauty? glory ſhine on duſt, and they not reflect on glory? <hi>Nimis durus animus, qui etſi amorem non vult impendere, tamen non vult rependere. Bernard.</hi> No ſoul ſo unworthy, as not to return love for love.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:62588:106"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Thou haſt an earneſt deſire and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him. How does the young heir (having intereſt) in his minority, long for the time when he ſhall be actually inveſted in his eſtate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? O how does the gracious ſoul pant and breathe, and hunger and thirſt, look and long for God! Never did the hungry man more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire bread, the hydroptical drink, the barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs rain, the thirſty traveller water, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued Hart the water-brooks, the longing woman the hour of her delivery, than it doth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and enjoyment of God. <hi>All my deſire, Lord, is before thee,</hi> ſaith our <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38.9, 10. <hi>My heart panteth, my ſtrength faileth— My ſoul hath fainted for thy ſalvation, and it breaketh for the longing it hath to thy judgements at all times,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>It is athirſt for God, for the living God,</hi> not <hi>ſiti miſerae indigentiae,</hi> but <hi>copioſioris fruitionis. Parthian</hi>-like, the more the ſoul hath imbib'd of this <hi>Helicon</hi> fountain, the more it thirſts. Oh the ſecret breathings, earneſt longings, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate cravings, vehement ejaculations, reſtleſs inquietations of a gracious ſoul after its God! By theſe wings of deſire, the ſoul (like <hi>Davids</hi> Dove) would flie up to Heaven. Others may deſire gold and ſilver, friends and relations, pleaſures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, comforts and conveniencies in the world, but the deſire of the Churches ſoul, is only to his Name, and to the remembrance of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. Could we be privy to the private devotions of the Saints, how many affectionate oh's and options ſhould we hear breath'd forth! how many even unutterable ſighs and groans ſent up for this to Heaven!</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:62588:106"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Thy delight is wholly placed in God, and thou findeſt ſole ſatisfaction in him. The ſoul is wrapt up into an holy joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, drawn up to an exceeding complacency in him. God alone is the feaſt of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and with the one diſh of the light of his countenance, he is infinitely more ſatisfied, than the worldling is with his moſt largely ſpread and fully furniſht table. His Attributes are the ſouls chear, and his Promiſes his choice delicacies. He is abundantly ſatiated with the goodneſs of his houſe, and drinks of his pleaſures as a River: his communions are meat and muſick too. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt been my help</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>therefore in the ſhadow of thy wings will I rejoyce. My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> Pſal. 63.5, 7. The enjoyment of God is to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wretch but a dry husk, but to the Saint <hi>a feaſt of fat things, and as Wines well refined on the Lees.</hi> Though a thouſand Torches of creature-comforts be light, its night, dark with his ſoul, till this Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines; but one ſmile of his face, and beam of his countenance, puts more gladneſs than could all Corn, Wine and Oyl, or does to thoſe who daily ſuck out their vertues and ſweetneſſes. God is his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples portion, and the only Paradiſe of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and while carnal men ſit chirping on the dunghill of outward felicities, he with the winged Lark ſings never ſo merrily as when mounting up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>His heart greatly rejoyceth in him, and his Song doth praiſe him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. The Joy of the Lord is his ſtrength, and it is ſo lively and vigorous, as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62588:107"/>even in Winter time it buds and bloſſoms forth from the God of his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>A Fifth might be added, of Faith and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it's his Periphraſis in the Text, <hi>whoſe hope is in the Lord his God;</hi> in his Name doth he lift up his Banners. As propriety is the ground of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſo of dependance: Though he kills me, I will truſt in him, though he damns me, I will love him: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> But not to prevent what follows.</p>
            <p>A Fifth and laſt character or impreſſion of due affection flowing from an Intereſt in God is reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to cleave to him with full purpoſe of heart, to live and die with him, and whatſoever befalls him, not to forget him, or deal falſiy in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, his heart ſtarts not back, neither doth he decline a ſtep from his Law. Whatſoever oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he meets withall in the way of his duty, he leaps over it all, being reſolved though Princes ſpeak againſt him, to meditate in his ſtatures, and ſeeing him that is inviſible, he fears not with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to venture on the wrath of Man, rather than forfeit the love and favour of God, but with holy <hi>Daniel</hi> will continue in his Supplications, and abide in the way of his duty, though it coſts him his life. And as good old <hi>Jacob,</hi> when to part with his <hi>Benjamin: If I be bereaved, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved;</hi> and Queen <hi>Eſther, If I periſh, I periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Fifth character of one intereſted in God, is a renouncing and abandoning all other intereſts for him, of ſin, Satan, or the World. The Soul that hath once ſteept and bathed it ſelf in this Ocean of delights, yea taſted once of divine ſweetneſs, will never reliſh thoſe waters of bitterneſs again;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62588:107"/>that hath been fed with the bread and dainties in his Fathers Houſe, will never return with the Swine of the World to feed on husks; That hath eaten of that heavenly and delicious Manna, will never fall to the Leeks and Onyons of this world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Egypt</hi> again. <hi>Ad majora nata es O anſina mea</hi>— Regular apprehenſions of God raiſe and advance the Soul above the World, <hi>None in Heaven but thee</hi>— The Servant who engages with his new Maſter, takes a Releaſe from his old, a diſcharge from his former ſervice. <hi>Lord, other Lords</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>have ruled over us, but now we will make mention only of thy Name,</hi> Iſa. 26. <hi>None of us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>live to our ſelves, but to the Lord,</hi> Rom. 14.8. They are men of another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Moſes choſe rather to ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Sixth mark or evidence is earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and vehement purſuit after God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Soul makes it his <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to follow after him. <hi>My ſoul preſſeth hard after thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, even as the Hunter after his prey,</hi> Pſal. 63.8. He follows God fully, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24. full chaſe he drives after God, more knowledge and experience of him, more communion and acquaintance with him. He ſets himſelf to ſeek the Lord. His heart does not hang down; but he is lift up in the way of the Lord, and to his Commandments which he hath loved. He ſings in the ways of the Lord. He walks in them and is not weary, runs in them, and is not faint; he exerciſeth himſelf to Godlineſs, makes Religion his trade and buſineſs. He walks with God, and worthy of the Lord in all well-pleaſing,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62588:108"/>and 'tis his meat and drink to do the will of his Father in Heaven: He thinks nothing too much, all too little for God; ſpares no labour, coſt or pains, to acquaint himſelf more with him. He prays, he hears, he reads, he meditates, he weeps, he watcheth, he runs, he fights, he ſtrives, and all to obtain further aſſurance, to apprehend that for which he is apprehended of him.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the more general ſigns of our Intereſt in God. To touch ſecondly about a few more ſpecial ſigns of having him our help and hope.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If God be our Help, and we ſo make him, there will be a diſobligation to, and utter diſcarding of, rejection, and caſting away all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-confidence. The Soul hath no confidence in the arm of fleſh, as to its ſpiritual condition, not in Means and Ordinances, gifts, parts, duties, graces, enjoyments, but accounts all loſs;— as to its temporal condition, it truſts not to its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wit, policy, ſtrength, wealth, eſtate, friends,— makes not fine Gold its hope, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in vindication of his integrity, <hi>cap.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Ezra</hi> was aſhamed to go with a requeſt to the King, though in a good Cauſe, having firſt declared his truſt in his God, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.12. A gracious Soul renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all carnal dependencies whatſoever. Neither Circumciſion or Uncircumciſion avails him; he glorieth only in the Lord. He will not pluck the Crown off the head of Free grace, or ſnatch it out of the hand of Divine power, to ſet it on the head of a poor finite Creature. A carnal heart can truſt any thing but God, a Chriſtian can truſt nothing but God, him before any thing, all things.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62588:108"/>A Worldling can truſt God in nothing, a Saint in all things, at all times; can truſt him with his Name, Eſtate, Liberty, Life, Soul, his all; truſt him in good dayes, of peace and proſperity, in evil dayes, of trouble and adverſity; being <hi>carefull for nothing, but in every thing making his requeſts known to God with Prayer and Thanksgiving;</hi> committing his whole way and care to him and his Providence.</p>
            <p>Which is a ſecond Note. A conſtant exerciſe of dependance on God, and on God alone. He is his hope, and his habitation to which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually reſorts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.2. Do's he want any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he goes by Faith and Prayer, to his God for it; do's he meet with any miſchief or injury, he goes again and pours forth his overwhelmed Soul in complaints before the Lord; he waits for him, and looks to him. His <hi>eyes are up to the Heavens, whence his help comes,</hi> Mic. 7.7. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith the Church, <hi>will I look to the Lord, and wait upon the God of my ſalvation.</hi> And ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 5.3. <hi>In the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up.</hi> When he hath ſhut his mouth, he will open his eye, his ear, and when himſelf knows not what to do, hear what his God will ſay. He is alwayes confident in the Lord, and triumphs in the God of his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe an Hypocrite may harbour a falſe dependance, and a counterfeit hope, as well as a Chriſtian a well-grounded confidence, let us try it by ſome following Touch-ſtones; which is the third and laſt particular concern'd in this Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, with which I ſhall diſmiſs it, namely, to give ſome Notes, or lay before you ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62588:109"/>and effects of a Saints fixed hope in the Lord his God, which may diſcriminate and contradiſtinguiſh it from the languiſhing and vaniſhing hope of Hypocrites, and carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. And them take in theſe following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A godly mans hope is a grounded Hope. He hath the root of the matter in him. The righteous hath an everlaſting foundation; the Hypocrite hath no bottom. <hi>Theſe have no root, Luk.</hi> 9.13. The houſe on the Sands was raiſed to an equal height with that on the Rock, and the difference was not in the ſuperſtructure, but only in the foundation. A carnal man may have as firm a confidence as a Saint, and an Hypocrite as ſtrong a preſumption as an upright Soul hath a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but not ſo good an evidence. Now confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is always nought without evidence. The jetting hope of an Hypocrite is built upon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal profeſſion and priviledges, as a worldlings is on his meer outward enjoyments. His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in the fleſh, but a Saints hope is bred and maintained too by the Word, and Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19. It's nouriſht by ſpiritual influences and experiences. As it is founded on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that bringing in of a better hope, that hope in us of our glory, ſo 'tis backt with good evidence. <hi>I will truſt in him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, though he kills me, I will maintain mine own wayes before him. He alſo is become my ſalvation: but an Hypocrite ſhall not come before him,</hi> cap. 13.15, 16. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls a Believers, <hi>a good hope through grace,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.16. through grace favouring as the Spring, and grace ſanctifying as the ſuel of it.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:62588:109"/>
            <p>Secondly, It is an Effectual hope, hath a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vertue and efficacy in it, eſpecially a ſix-fold vertue.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Ad purificandum;</hi> to purifie the heart and Conſcience of a Chriſtian. What the Apoſtle ſaith of Faith may be ſaid of Hope, <hi>it purifies the heart.</hi> Yea, he ſayes it expreſly of this grace alſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>He that hath this hope purifies himſelf even as God is pure: Secundum ſpeciem,</hi> though not <hi>gradum,</hi> in kinde and quality, though not equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: If not in act, yet at leaſt in endeavour and affection. Hope purgeth the Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God; by it the Soul draws nigh to God, and comes to have a ſight and view of him, and <hi>Omnis viſio affimilat.</hi> Proportionable to our Faith is our Holineſs, and to our Expectations our Converſation. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth it from all Formaliſts preſumption. Hypocrites lean on the Lord, and are confident of his preſence amongſt them, though they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate all manner of wickedneſs, and do all kind of abominations, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. But in vain do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners load Gods back, and yet pretend to lean on his Arm. Security and preſumption lead men to ſin: Iſa 57.10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way, yet thou ſaidſt not, there is no hope: Thou haſt found the life of thine hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved.</hi> And deſperation alſo makes them ruſh on in courſes of Iniquity. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. <hi>They ſaid, there is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his evil heart;</hi> a ſad and deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. But true hope draws the Soul off from ſin. Whatſoever a Childe of God doth, he will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62588:110"/>not ſin againſt, and away his hopes; but having hope in Gods Word, and in thoſe great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes, he cleanſeth himſelf from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12, 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Ad excitandum,</hi> it quickens unto du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It's a living, yea, a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. Where hope is in the centre, obedience is in the circumference. <hi>David</hi> conjoyns them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.166. <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and done thy Commandments.</hi> Believing puts upon doing. Hope of mercy quickens and animates to duty. We believe, and therefore we ſpeak and act too: and no good hope of the end without due uſe of the means; means muſt be uſed, if a bleſſing expected. Faith hath a piercing eye, and a powerful hand; a receptive faculty, to take in the comfort of the Promiſe, and a reverberative, to return, and reflect its benefit received in waies of duty and obedience. Hoping to the end, and girding up the loyns of our minds, are paired, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. In order to a progreſs in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Journey. The ſweetneſs of the Promiſe drawn out, incourageth and engageth in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the command. The Plow-man plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and Seeds-man ſoweth in hope. Expectation of reward edgeth to work. Diſuſe and neglect of means, doth not truſt God, but tempt him. True confidence ſpurs up to duty, eſpecially to prayer. Truſting and calling are coupled in Scripture, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.2. Hope of ſpeeding puts a man on ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hope of an expected end, put holy <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> on praying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19. And of ſalvation holy <hi>Paul</hi> on labouring and ſuffering reproach, on active and paſſive obedience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:62588:110"/>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ad commorandum,</hi> to take the ſoul off all carnal dependance, and ſtay it by a firm dependance on God alone. The hoping ſoul goes not to creatures, to ſecond cauſes, leans on none of theſe broken ſtaves, and vain confidences; but rejects and renounceth them all, both upon a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal account. It's the brand and mark of an Hypocrite, even carnal confidence. It's the character of a Chriſtian, to have no confidence in the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. He does not only call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the holy City, but ſtaies himſelf on the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.20. A Chriſtian will not have two ſtrings to the bow of his truſt. The Pſalmiſt puts a direct oppoſition to truſt in God, and all other truſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that maketh the Lord his truſt; and reſpecteth not the proud, nor ſuch as turn aſide to lyes.</hi> And the Church ſolemnly profeſſeth her rejection of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helps in time of her ſtraits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.6. <hi>I will not truſt to my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me</hi> — not to the bow, but the arm that helps to do it. And ſo ſhe ſeals a renunciation of all creature-aids and aſſiſtances, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes</hi>— Carnal men (like weak and ignorant people) go firſt to the Kitchin, and then to the Phyſitian. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaw his ſickneſs, and beheld his wound, he goes to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and ſends to King <hi>Jareb</hi> to heal him. But the Church eccho's to Gods call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>In vain is ſalvation expected from Hills or Mountains, in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael</hi>— We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God. She goes firſt to the Lord, and then to the Phyſitian.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:62588:111"/>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ad componendum,</hi> to pacifie the ſoul, and make it wait patiently the returns of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Jacob</hi> waited for Gods ſalvation, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> for the Kingdom of God. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 40.1. As they who watch for the morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. As the poor traveller, beweildred all night, longs for the mornings approach to direct him in his paſſage: and the induſtrious labourer waits the morning light, and dawning of the day, that he may go about the work of his calling: or the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant ſouldier, and diligent watchman deſires the break of day, when they may be relieved: ſo doth a gracious ſoul wait for his God. The Church was reſolved thus to wait upon the Lord. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. Though an Atheiſt will wait no longer, a Saint will both wait for inſtruction and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hopes concluſions are. Gods time is the beſt time. The viſion is but for an appointed time, it will come, and not tarry, wait for it. If deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance comes not this, it may come another way. If mercy comes not to day, it may come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. It's better ſtaying a day too long, than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſalvation come an hour too ſoon. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſoul waits for the hope of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by faith; yea he hopes to the end for the grace to be brought at the revelation of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. He waits till the Lord be gracious; he is not too quick or haſty (haſty births he knows are commonly abortive) he will not make more haſte than good ſpeed; he underſtands it's but manners to wait the Lords leiſure, and attend his pleaſure. God waited long for his coming in, in a way of duty, it's but meet he ſhould wait
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62588:111"/>for his approaches in a way of mercy. If God could ſtay ſo long for his converſion, it's but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable he ſhould ſtay for his conſolations. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved he is to wait ſo long as God pleaſes for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of mercy, and wholly reſolves his will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of his Maker, even let's it be buried and ſwallowed up of it, with a <hi>Father, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> Carnal men would limit God to their deſires, and ſcant him to their time, they are for duty to morrow, but mercy and ſalvation to day. Now mercy muſt come, or never. But a Chriſtian would not have his time Gods; but makes Gods time his; and whatſoever pleaſeth God, therefore pleaſeth him. It's not (ſaith true hope) for us to know the times and ſeaſons, better to wait for the Lords ſalvation. Better want of mercy in a way of waiting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, than its approach without it: Does God delay, he does not deny; is mercy deferred, it is not reſolved againſt; does God withdraw, hide his face, ſeem to ſlight, and caſt out his Peoples prayer, yet I will not give over pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting, believing, and expecting, I will yet attend the motions of providence in the uſe of means; and though God ſeems to caſt us off, yet we will never caſt off him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Ad elevandum,</hi> to raiſe the ſoul above all worldly expectations. He that by hope hath gotten his foot up to Heaven, looks upon all this inferiour world only as an inconſideral point. <hi>Our converſation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is in Heaven, whence we look for the Saviour.</hi> Heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and heavenly converſation go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he once received a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62588:112"/>of the <hi>American</hi> world, gave all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms he had conquered amongſt his Captains, and upon this diviſion, being asked what he had left to himſelf, anſwered, <hi>ſpem majorum annorum;</hi> the hope of further years. A Chriſtian hearing of the Alſufficiency of God, and glory of Heaven, of ſo much <hi>(in ſcriniis)</hi> in hope, is willing to part with whatſoever is in hand, and (like a provident and foreſeeing perſon) will part with all in poſſeſſion, for what he hath in reverſion; ſo did thoſe worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. A carnal man uſeth God, and enjoys the world; a Saint uſeth the world, but enjoyeth God only.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Ad corroborandum,</hi> to fortifie and confirm the ſoul againſt all oppoſition. <hi>Abraham</hi> rowed againſt the ſtream. Hope will ride the ſtorm. It may be ſaid of hope, what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of charity, it endures all things. There is the work of faith, labour of love, and patience of hope, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>I will hope continually,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> Pſal. 71.14. Though his enemies be lively, yet his hope is not dead; and while they threaten more, he yet hopes more and more. All the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of humane oppoſition cannot quench this fire, but it's like the fire of the Sanctuary, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes out. True hope grows by diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the wind of worldly affliction ſerves but to increaſe this holy flame. When as the ſpies gave a diſcouraging account of the Land, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were not diſmay'd at their own ſight, or their report, but conclude, Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is departed, and they are bread for us. <hi>They that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength,</hi> and their hope too; and under the loweſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62588:112"/>they have yet a <hi>ſpero meliora</hi> in their mouths, which keeps them from fainting and ſinking. And that leads to the third and laſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the Saints hope. It's ſtedfaſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. A Believer hath hope in his end, and he hopes to the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The full aſſurance of hope to the end:</hi> And ſo <hi>cap.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoſe houſe we are, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the hope firm unto the end.</hi> God perfects this grace, whereſoever he begins it. An Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is a dying hope; a Saints, a living hope; there is a vigour and vivacity, and alſo a conſtancy and perpetuity in it. <hi>We are not of them who draw back to perdition</hi> — An Hypocrites hope is an empty and vain, and ſo a vaniſhing hope, it hath no ſolidity in it, but appears a meer husk, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan comes to threſh it by his temptations, it will not ſtand, or endure a trial. When he comes to go out of the world, his hope periſheth for ever, and breaths forth it ſelf into a puff of wind, though ſwoln to never ſo huge a bulk, and great a proportion. It hath no ſtalk, and when the Sun of divine indignation, or humane perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth, it wholly withereth: But a Saint (though for a while he may loſe the exerciſe) never wholly loſeth the habit of his hope; his hope is a fixed, ſtable, ſetled hope, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. A carnal wretch can hope in good daies, while providence looks on him with a favourable and pleaſing aſpect; but let the Lord come to frown on him, and lay affliction on his loyns, his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> like <hi>Nabals</hi>) dies within him, he ſinks like a ſtone, he carries with him a ſad heart, and looks with a lowring and dejected countenance: but a

            <p>Thirdly, This ſpeaks ſharp reproof, even to the People of God themſelves, who are ſo apt to depend on, and run to means and ſecond cauſes in times of trouble and affliction, and not lay their hope and help on this God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his truth and faithfulneſs only. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was very prone to this corruption, to ſeek to, and rely on forein aids and helps, neglecting and refuſing to reſt upon God. This is ſinners wickedneſs, and Saints weakneſs and infirmity. This was the fault of good <hi>Aſa,</hi> zealous <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> holy <hi>David,</hi> who thought nothing better for them, than one to go to the Phyſitians before the Lord; another, to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favour with the King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and a third, to flie into the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Vitium oſtendit</hi> (ſaith a Commentator on the Text) <hi>dum oſtendit remedium.</hi> This is natural to the loſt, but yet proud Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> The firſt man had a ſpice of pride in him, and all his poſterity have gotten a tang of it. The ſtout ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier will never accept quarter, as long as he can ſtand out againſt the enemy, or defend the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged City againſt his power and violence. Proud
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62588:113"/>ſtout-hearted man would neither be beholden to God or Chriſt for his help, could he but be his own Protector and Saviour. We are all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture run-aways from God, and having a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding heart within us, are apt to revolt more and more, leaning on any broken Reed before him the eternal Rock. But this our way is our folly. This is our great ſin, and runs us alſo into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable labyrinth of calamity and woe. It's no leſs than <hi>crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> when we have the covering of the Almighty's protection, and the wing of the great and everlaſting <hi>Jehovah</hi> to come under, yet to ſhroud our ſelves under the alien ſhadow of any creature; and when we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighfully ſollace our ſelves under the Vines ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Olives fatneſs, yet to ſhelter our ſelves under the vain ſhew of the Bramble. It's too convincing an Argument both of the weakneſs of grace, that our ſtrength is ſmall, and alſo of the power and predominancy of corruption. It's a plain and demonſtrative Argument of a carnal heart, to ſatisfie our ſelves with any outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment in the day of mercy, or ſupport, in the hour of miſery. How ſadly does God complain of this in his <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.22. They believed not in the Lord, nor truſted in his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Ye rebelled againſt the Commandment of the Lord your God</hi> (to go up againſt the Nations) <hi>and ye believed him not.</hi> God taxeth it of high diſingenuity and diſloyalty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>What iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.13, 14. <hi>The Virgin of Iſrael hath done a very horrible thing: Will a man
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62588:114"/>leave the Snow of Lebanon, which cometh from the Rock of the field? or ſhall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forſaken?</hi> It's a tincture of Apoſtacy from God: Indeed a plain contradiction to our converſion. In that we turn from the Creature to the Creator, in this from the Creator to the Creature. It's a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and refined Idolatry, and therefore it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, theſe two are Couzen-Germans, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-ſins, and but one remove one from the other. Yea, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dolatry charged by the Apoſtle upon the Gentiles, hath this inſcription on its forehead; <hi>They worſhipped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator, God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 1.25. And indeed whatſoever a man ſets up above or equal with God, it's his God, or at leaſt his Idol. And as it is a great iniquity, ſo it is commonly rewarded with exemplary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This truſt is both wicked and vain; it makes us neglect God the eternal Refuge; and while it deceives us, and makes us miſs of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground of truſt, it alſo weakens and debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates both our hearts and hands; our hands in duty, and our hearts in confidence. (who will ever ſet upon that of which he hath no hopes of accompliſhment? and who ever will go to God that can go any where elſe?) It's a following lying vanities, and forſaking our own mercies; a running from the fountain of everlaſting waters, and hewing out broken ciſterns. It laies us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe, and that a dreadful one, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 13. <hi>Curſed is he that makes fleſh his arm — All that forſake thee ſhall be aſhamed, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thee, their names written in the Earth;</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:62588:114"/>than which nothing more ſad and diſmal. A curſed change it is to leave God, and go to the Creature; ſuch confidence commonly ends in ſhame and confuſion. Dependance on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forfeits divine protection; it clips the wings of mercy: It's a going out of Gods bleſſing into the warm Sun. Nay, the Hypocrites bow, which never aims right on at the mark, is not only er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and deceitful, but often recoils, and proves to him deadly and deſtructive. They who repoſe in humane help, do not only miſs of the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſafety, which by theſe means they made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to attain to, but bring evils on themſelves, which they both ſought and thought to eſcape, and loſe the lives they went about ſo induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave. And indeed God takes himſelf high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wronged by this abuſe at the hands of his People, and will ſooner or later ſay to them as to <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 10. <hi>Go to the gods ye have choſen, and ſee if they can deliver you.</hi> See how God threatens them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.12, 15.—<hi>In returning and reſt I would have ſaved you— and ye would not, but ye ſaid, no, we will flee upon horſes— therefore ſhall ye flee—</hi> They who will not reſt on God, ſhall be forced to run for all the creature. May I not ſay to you, as once <hi>Saul</hi> to the people revolting to <hi>David, Can the Son of Jeſſe give you Vineyards and Olive-yards</hi>— Can the creature give you ſouls ſatisfaction in its fulleſt enjoyment, and can it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you relief in the day of diſtreſs? Can theſe gods of your own making ariſe and ſave you? Can they chear your hearts, when God is frowning? ſuccour you, when Satan is tempting? comfort you, when the world is failing? Can they give
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62588:115"/>you any peace in an hour of trouble, eaſe under horrours of pain, life under pains of death, ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and compoſure in a day of diſtraction and confuſion? have you not ſufficiently experienced, and ſo may be effectually convinced of the vanity of the whole arm of fleſh? That all fleſh is as graſs that fadeth, and the flower thereof that withereth. That men of low degree are vanity, and of high degree a lye, That there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Hills or Mountains, no help in Princes, Senates, Armies, Navies, if God does but blow upon them? Have you not by ſad and wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience known the failure of friends, contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of eſtates, the uncertainty of worldly advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the moth, the worm, the dying periſhing nature that is in all created comforts and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? and will ye yet lean upon theſe weak bulruſhes, and make his your refuge? May not God ſay to you, as once to his People, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.11. <hi>How long will it be ere ye believe me?</hi> Nay, may not God juſtly leave you, when ye have firſt left him? and then what will become of you? To which of all the Saints will ye turn? what will ye do in the day that he comes out to viſit? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God coming out with the glittering ſword in the one hand (nay, he is come out already) and the deſtroying Plague in the other, and fire and famine become his followers; whither will ye fly? where will ye hide? how ſhall you eſcape or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his fierce wrath, and burning indignation? what will you do in the day of your calamity? or where will you leave your glory? Well, to cloſe this point (for I would hope better things of all you that fear God, though I thus ſpeak) know
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62588:115"/>aſſuredly, that by going from God your Centre, unto the Creature, you will either run into the mouth of danger (like a bird far from her neſt, never under ſuch danger of the ſnare) you cannot be eſtabliſhed, but may be (as they were <hi>Jude</hi> 5.) for their unbelief deſtroyed; or however you will cut ſhort the arm of mercy and deliverance. As impatient ſnatching at mercy, makes it not half ſo ſweet; fruits pluckt too ſoon, or raw eaten, commonly gripe. <hi>Jacob</hi> had not only a blow, but a piece of a curſe, a deal of turmoil and trouble with his bleſſing, becauſe he would be his own Carver, and not ſtay to receive it at his heavenly Fathers hand, and diſcontented murmurs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings againſt God under affliction, cut ſhort of mercy and ſalvation; a ſad inſtance whereof we have in thoſe two prime Leaders of <hi>Iſrael, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Becauſe they believed not the Lord, to ſanctifie him before the eyes of Iſrael,</hi> they were not priviledged to lead the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the good Land. So confident repoſes in the Creature, without God, or conjunction of it in our dependance with him, will certainly breed in the iſſue diſappointment and deſtruction; and the ſoul that with <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſits Lady-like in its Chair of State and Eaſe, will become a Widow and deſolate in one day. And (which is the great aggravation of the miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry of all ſuch confidence) the more we lean, and greater ſtreſs we lay on any creature-comfort, when God comes once to blaſt it, and take it away (as 'twere) by a ſtroke, it will become ſo much the greater croſs, and ſo much affliction we may expect from it, as we have had affection to it, and placed dependance
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62588:116"/>upon it. Put not your truſt therefore in man, or place your confidence in bare Creatures, for whoſe ſhoulders an immortal Soul carries too great a burden, but <hi>Truſt in the Lord from henceforth and for ever.</hi> Let me conclude this with the Prophets advice, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his might, nor the rich man in his riches, But let him that glorieth glory in the Lord:</hi> And with that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8, 10. <hi>Truſt not in Oppreſſion— if riches increaſe, ſet not your heart upon them.</hi> But truſt in him at all times, and finally with that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Truſt not in uncertain riches, but in the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Solamen miniſtrat.</hi> This Doctrine comes full fraught with comfort, and ſpeaks abundant and matchleſs conſolation to all the People of God, who have this Intereſt in him, and exerciſe dependance upon him as their hope and help. The godly man is the only bleſſed man. The World may count and call her darlings happy but no ſuch bleſſedneſs to be found as in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and derivations from him. <hi>Bleſſed he is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In all his Relations and concernments, as to his ſpiritual ſtate, and as to his temporal. He having an intereſt in God, hath an intereſt in all that is Gods; all his Attributes, Relations, Promiſes, Providences, gracious and mercifull Benedictions; he hath a right to all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, pardon of ſin, peace of Conſcience, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, grace and glory; and all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mercies too, the fatneſs of the Earth, as well as the dews of Heaven, the Nether as well as the Upper Springs: All is his by right and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62588:116"/>and ſhall be by poſſeſſion, if good for him. As a ſtranger from God is univerſaily curſed, ſo is one united to him univerſally bleſſed. He may ſay, <hi>God hath dealt graciouſly with me, and I have enough,</hi> Gen. 33.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is alſo happy in all Eſtates and Conditions. Nothing amiſs can befall and betide a Chriſtian. Though never ſo evil in it ſelf, Gods Power and Providence can work it for good. Art thou under deſertions, yet thou art happy. <hi>His leſt hand is under thee, and his right hand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth thee:</hi> Thou art graven upon the palms of his hands (ſo as to be no more defaced or oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) and thy walls are continually before him. Haſt thou loſt thy hold of God, he hath ſtill his hold on thee, canſt thou not caſt thy ſelf, and roll thy Soul on Chriſt in the Promiſe? yet, when thou comeſt out of the Wilderneſs, thou mayſt lean on the arm of thy beloved. Though thy Soul be never ſo much in the dark, thou haſt the ſtaffe of <hi>Jacob</hi> to lean on, and needeſt never fear ſtumbling, eſpecially falling, for the Lord alſo upholds thee by his hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.24. Art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temptations, ſtill thou mayſt be happy. Thy Redeemers Interceſſion is a ſhore of thy Faith, and pillar of thy Perſeverance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. Though weak in thy ſelf, with the Conies thou mayſt fly to the Rocks: When purſued by that mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi> and hunter of Souls, and furiouſly chaſed by the avenging Executioner of Divine wrath, haſte into the arms and boſom of thy Saviour which ſtand extended on the Croſs, and are now wide open to receive thee: When theſe proud waters overwhelm thee, ſwim to that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62588:117"/>Rock of his Merits which is higher than thou; and then thou mayſt (like a man gotten on the top of a rock in the midſt of the Sea, outbraving with an invincible courage and undaunted reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the waves and billows about him) dare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to do his worſt againſt thee. Though the Beaſt makes warre againſt thee being a follower of the Lamb, God is on thy ſide, and ſtands by thee in the combat: this Dragon ſhall not ſwallow thee up: the Lord will rebuke him, yea tread him under thy feet ſhortly. Though thy own heart be a Traitor, thy God is thy Keeper. Art thou engaged with ſtrong and violent corruptions, do theſe Maſters of miſrule bid controll to Gods grace in thee, and is the battell ſo ſharp as ſometimes the fleſh ſeems to overcome the Spirit, thy pride, paſſion, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, earthly-mindedneſs are too hard for thee? be not diſcouraged: Though thou beeſt foiled, thou ſhalt not be overcome; ſin ſhall not have dominion over thee, though it may tyrannize againſt thee; but thoſe thine enemies that will not bow before the Scepter of Chriſts Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall be ſlain before his face, and very ſhortly thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> thou ſeeſt to day, thou ſhalt ſee no more for ever. Art thou expoſed to wants and exigencies? The Lord is thy Shepherd, and he will ſupply thee as to thy ſpiritual, and alſo thy temporal condition. Doſt thou want the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Divine Ordinances, are all theſe Conduits ſtopt, and windows ſhut? God will himſelf be a Tabernacle to thee; he will prepare a Table for thee in the Wilderneſs, ſpread with all the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweet-meats of grace and comfort, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe on thee with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62588:117"/>healing in his wings. Doſt thou want Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts? The Earth is the Lords Granary, and the fullneſs thereof, and the Sea thy Fathers Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, and therefore thou ſhalt have what either can afford thee. Art thou ſequeſtred of all that is dear and precious in thine eyes? Thou haſt yet a <hi>Deus providebit</hi> to live on, a Promiſe to bear thee up, that God will never forſake thee, all things ſhall be added to thee. <hi>Qui majora curat, non minora negliget.</hi> The Acceſſory follows the Principal. There is no Promiſe indeed of adding Spirituals upon our ſeeking Temporals, but there is of adding the things of Earth, if we ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven. Thou ſhalt have food and raiment in the way wherein thou art to goe; enough, though not too much; according to Gods will, though it may be not thine own; bread for thy body, though not for thy luſts; to ſatisfie thee, though not ſurfeit; content, though not cloy thee. God will give thee the World as a bleſſing, though not lade thee with this thick clay as a burden. As thou haſt the ſure Mercies of <hi>David,</hi> whereof none can deprive thee, ſo thou ſhalt have all external accommodations, or at leaſt a proportion between thy Heart and Condition, wherein the only comfort of life conſiſteth. Art thou compaſſed about with fears and dangers, of enemies or evils imminent or impendent? Let not thine heart be troubled, for Mercy compaſſes thee about on every ſide: As <hi>Eliſha</hi> told his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.16. <hi>There are more with thee than are againſt thee.</hi> Thou haſt a guard of Angels round about thee, yea Chriſt himſelf for thy Protector. And <hi>Fortior eſt Chriſtus caput Eccleſiae ad prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62588:118"/>quam Diabolus hoſtis Eccleſiae ad oppugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> Cyprian. This may be a bottom of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſufficient ground and encouragement to the People of God in the darkeſt and gloomieſt day, the moſt evil and diſcouraging time; and ſerve to allay, and antidote all their fears and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of heart, that they have an infinite and everlaſting God for their help, and have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength, wiſdom, faithfulneſs, mercy and compaſſion engaged for them. Men count it an happineſs to have a Cottage of their own to hide their heads in. God is his Peoples ſhelter, Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and hiding-place under all their ſcatterings, and diſperſions, oppreſſions and oppoſitions, they meet with in the World. <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the Godly out of all their temptations.</hi> The Apoſtle brings it down to an experience, <hi>He delivered</hi> Lot, <hi>and he knows how to deliver us.</hi> It's all one to have no ſtorm, or to have an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-place. Under all private injuries and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we may truſt in God who is a preſent help, and go to him with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s words in our mouths when the men of <hi>Anathoth</hi> ſought his life, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.20. <hi>To thee O Lord, do I reveal my cauſe,</hi> and be confident as he was, <hi>cap.</hi> 20.11. of deliverance; or as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> opened his mouth ſo wide againſt Heaven, he went and ſpread the Letter before the Lord. Though a man meets with nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilities, unkindneſſes, diſcouragements, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, reproaches, perſecutions and violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from men, yet there is enough in one God to counter-ballance all. God will work all miſchiefs about for good; and as for Enemies, in the Name
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62588:118"/>of the Lord we may go out againſt them and overcome them. Art thou under croſſes and loſſes, and ſore and vexatious trialls that way? haſt loſt thy Eſtate, and Poſſeſſions, thy Relations, thy former Friends, thy preſent comforts, thy hopes, thy all? yet thou haſt not loſt thy God, who is better than all. And as <hi>Zeno</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid once, when he had loſt all by Shipwrack, <hi>Licet me tutius philoſophari.</hi> Thou haſt now the better leiſure to attend thy Soul, and ſtudy Heaven. Though a man loſeth his Moneys, and is rich in Bills and Bonds, it's no great matter: When thou haſt not a penny in thy Purſe, thou haſt thouſands in the Promiſe. Gods providence, or mens vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may take away thy Eſtate, thy Children, thy Livelihood and ſubſiſtence, but never take away thy Chriſt. When thou haſt loſt all things elſe, yet thou canſt never loſe thy God, and thy inheritance, the hope laid up for thee in Heaven; that heavenly and never-failing treaſure is out of the reach both of Men and Devils. Art thou under afflictions perſonal, family? Hath the hand of God toucht thee? Hath his deſtroying Angel come with the Arrows of the Plague, and ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy habitation, ſo that thou art left alone, and become wholly comfortleſs, even ſwallowed up of ſorrow? Thy Relations are gone, thy Friends fled from thee, all thine acquaintance ſtand aloof off thy ſore; thou ſigheſt and mourneſt by day, weepeſt by night, and haſt none to comfort thee; thou art become like a Pelican in the Wilderneſs, an Owl in the Deſart, and ſitteſt like a Sparrow on the houſe-top: Death is entred in at thy win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and men have written <hi>Lord have Mercy</hi> on
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62588:119"/>thy doors, and thou haſt neither Miniſter nor Phyfitian to come at thee; yea, wanteſt Bread it ſelf to uphold thee: Yet fear not, Thy God is ſtill with thee, and then nighteſt, when all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures run away to the greateſt diſtance. Chriſt comes in yet familiarly at thy doors, God ſtands by thy beds ſide. Though the Plague hath ſeized thy body, he is not afraid to come neer thy ſoul, and while thy Friends forſake thee, he will be Friend, Phyſitian and Comforter to thee. He is the Lord that healeth thee: And thou ſhalt at laſt ſay, in faithfulneſs and mercy to thy Soul did he afflict thee; yea, that thou wert not ſick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord had forgiven thy iniquity. Nay, here is comfort for thee even in Death it ſelf, if thou haſt God for thy help, and he affords thee his gracious preſence, thou ſhalt not need fear to walk through that dark ſuburbs of Eternity. <hi>As dying, and yet ſhalt thou live.</hi> Death is but to thee a Portall into Everlaſting Life; and what is a grimm Serjeant to arreſt others, and Purſevant to hale them to the place of Execution, ſhall be a welcom Meſſenger to carry thee into thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, and uſher thee into the Preſence-Chamber of thy endeared Bridegroom. And when thou art gathered to thy Fathers, though thou goeſt to thy long, yet thou ſhalt not go to thy laſt home. Thy <hi>Exodus</hi> of Earth ſhall be thy <hi>Geneſis</hi> of Heaven; and when the great Landlord of Heaven and Earth, by a Commiſſion directed from his Royal Court ſummons thine immortal Soul out of this Clay-tenement of thy Body, thou ſhalt enter upon thine upper Houſe, thoſe ever-bleſſed Manſions prepared for thee; and this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62588:119"/>Bird in thy breaſt, when once let looſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cage where now it is impriſoned, and ſet upon the Tree of life in the midſt of that heavenly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, ſhall warble out the moſt melodious tunes, and ſweet and harmonious muſick to its Creator, even to the daies of Eternity. Let me conclude this conſolation with that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 14.32. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death:</hi> And add on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this challenge on this ſide the grave for him againſt the ſinner. Take a child of God cloathed with all poſſible diſadvantages, poverty, ſickneſs, perſecution, even at the worſt that can befall a man on this ſide Hell, and his condition is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly far better than any wicked mans on Earth, that hath ſumptuous buildings, furniſht tables, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant children, great riches and revenues: So hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he above all the world beſides that hath God for his help, the Lord for his God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Let this conſideration be a ſtrong perſwaſive both to the Saints and People of God, to walk worthy his help, and ſinners, to labour to make him their God and help againſt an evil day.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To Chriſtians, to walk anſwerably to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help and influx, both in a good, and in an evil day. Take the ſumm of this exhortation in five or ſix branches. Let the influence of Gods help be to you a ground of praiſe and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of ſatisfaction and acquieſcence, of acceſs to him on all occaſions, of confidence in him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition, of return to him according to your receivings from him, and of engagement and firm adherence to him, notwithſtanding all temptations to Apoſtacy from him.</p>
            <pb n="208" facs="tcp:62588:120"/>
            <p>Firſt, Matter of thankfulneſs. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord at all times;</hi> Let ſongs of benediction to him be ever in your mouths; pay him the conſtant tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of acknowledgement. What an holy Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick does <hi>David</hi> ſing? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.12. What a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous avouchment makes he? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1, 2. Where he gives God all his titles: My ſtrength, my goodneſs, my fortreſs, my ſhield, my high Tower, and deliverer: And ſo does <hi>Jeremiah, cap.</hi> 16.19. Even proclaim Gods Name to the Gentiles, that they might truſt in him. In Gods Name ſet up all your banners: Say with the Church, All our freſh ſprings are in thee. <hi>Nilus ab ignoto fonte</hi>— but our ſalvation comes from Sion; thence the Lord commands the bleſſing. We finde our Pſalmiſt frequent in theſe confeſſions, <hi>The Lord is on my ſide,</hi> Pſal. 118.6. <hi>I will ſing of thy power, yea I will ſing aloud of thy mercy in the morning, for thou haſt been my defence and refuge in the day of trouble</hi>— Pſal. 59.16, 17.

How oft have I ſinned
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62588:120"/>and he pardoned me, prayed, and he heard me, waited, and he was gracious to me? I was weak, but he ſtrengthened me, ſad, but he comforted me, troubled, but he ſpake peace to me. And ſo may the Church of God ſay, If the Lord had not been on my ſide, when the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated and bandied againſt me, complotted and conſpired againſt me, ſaying, Come, let us blot her name out of the book of remembrance, they ſhall neither know nor ſee till we come in the midſt of them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe, I had been long ago overthrown and overturned. It was not my own bow or ſword ſaved me, but thy right hand that helped me out of all my diſtreſſes. It is our great duty to rejoyce in the confeſſion of Gods Name in all our deliverances and ſalvations, and to aſcribe to him the glory that is his right and due. This Pſalm is Euchariſtical, penned on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as a grateful acknowledgement. We ſhould erect ſtanding Monuments of his goodneſs and love, and ſay, <hi>Hitherto hath he helped us;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the generations to come, the praiſes of the Lord, and the wonderful works he hath done for our ſouls, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16.71.18.78.4, 5, 6.—That they might alſo hope in God— And (as there alwaies appears that in mercy, which calls aloud for praiſes) ſo there are ſome deliverances that have ſuch ſignal remarks upon them, as we cannot poſſibly paſs over without ſpecial obſervation. How oft does mercy come undeſerved, unexpected, undeſired and unprayed for, is diſtinguiſhing (we are pluckt as fire-brands out of the fire, and taken when others are left) yea exceeding and ſuperabundant to all our hopes or thoughts? How many deliverances
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62588:121"/>do we know, before we know our dangers? the danger was only to be read in the deliverance. How many miſchiefs do we eſcape, that by all our forecaſt and prudence, we could never have prevented, nor yet by our power oppoſed? how many mercies come pouring upon us, not one of which by all our diligence and induſtry we could have purchaſed or procured? what good often ariſeth to us out of our evils, and that proves our greateſt advance, which we thought would have been our fatal and final downfall; and conduceth to our ſalvation, which ſeemed to promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but utter and irrecoverable ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Gods mercies thus renewed on us every morning, and his faithfulneſs every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, require a conſtant return of the ſacrifices of thankſgiving; but our ſin and miſery is, that our thankfulneſs for mercy granted, is no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our importunity for mercy wanted and deſired. In our ſtraits and afflictions we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a great deal to the Almighty, but when once gotton out of thoſe depths, we ſacrilegiouſly rob the God of our ſalvation, and put him off with the farthing candle of a little lip-devotion inſtead of a thank-offering of heart and life, wherein only lies the life of thankfulneſs. But where there is an Ark for deliverance, there ſhould be an Altar for thankfulneſs.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62588:121"/>promiſes, for temporals, to his providence. Do your ſouls want pardon of ſin, peace of ſpirit, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to duty, ſtrength againſt corruptions, grace for trials and ſufferings, fly to your God. Does Satan tempt, the world frown, friends prove unkind, hopes diſappoint, all creatures fail, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies compaſs you about, yet go to him your help, and cry with <hi>David, Plead my cauſe (O Lord) with them that ſtrive with me, and fight with thoſe that fight againſt me.</hi> Whatſoever condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls you, your ſtate is never hopeleſs, why ſhould it not then be fearleſs? never deſperate, why ſhould you be diſconſolate? There's hope at the bottom, <hi>dum ſpiro ſpero,</hi> may be your Motto. The Royal aid of Heaven will aſſiſt and enable you againſt all oppoſitions on Earth. Whom ſhould a people go to, but to their God? He is the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the whole world; The Iſles ſhall wait upon him, and on his arm ſhall they truſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.5. It's the great duty and ſafety too of the ſoul to truſt to and hope in the Lord. It's the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Saint to depend on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Our ſoul waiteth on the Lord, for he is our help and ſhield.</hi> It's a ſign of ſincerity, to truſt in the Lord, and the evidence of an Hypocrite, to truſt to any thing beſides him, <hi>Job</hi> 8.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.31. The poor of his people ſhall truſt in him; and <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Thou ſhalt leave in the midſt of them a poor afflicted people, and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Not patience, but faith is the higheſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a Chriſtian. This was <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> grand <hi>Encomium</hi> given him by the Spirit of God himſelf, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. He truſted in the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and clave to him. God takes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62588:122"/>pleaſure, and delights in them that hope in his mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. God hath curſed all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-confidence. He hath pronounced them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which hope in himſelf: Yea, Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed. It's the higheſt piece of honour and happineſs, that any created being is capable of, to receive influence from, and exerciſe dependance upon its Creator. There is an utter inſufficiency in all creatures to help; they may give painted comfort, ape a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit happineſs, but never afford real or laſting conſolations. Yea, the ſoul may be reduced to ſuch ſt aits and exigencies, as all the power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and induſtry of all creatures cannot give him relief, none but God help him (as under troubles of conſcience, and perplexity of ſpirit, none elſe can ſuccour.) A wounded ſpirit none can bear, and only God can heal. If help comes there, it muſt come <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, immediately from Heaven. Friends cannot help, Miniſters not help, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Chriſtians not help, prayers, tears, and duties not help, only the God of Heaven. And as he is ſometimes only able, ſo he is himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies able, when none elſe can, either on the right hand, or on the left. It's all one with him to help by many, or by few, or by none at all.

He can make the choiceſt and moſt hopeful inſtruments, to prove our vexers, and not our Saviours: He can cut off
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62588:122"/>the ſpirit of Princes, and be terrible to the Kings of the Earth. An Hoſt without him, much more againſt him, is a vain thing for ſafety; and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude as inſignificant as a ſingle perſon; he can ſmite heaps upon heaps, with the touch of his little finger, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did once the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs: He can blow on the moſt likely projects uſed for help and ſupply, ſo as they ſhall utterly fail, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.11.

And as he can ruin by the hand of friends, ſo he can ſave by the hand of an enemy; when there is no healer unto a ſoul or people, he can, he can yet do the cure: what is deſigned and intended for evil, he can work good out of, and order for good to his People. And as he hath ability enough, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to work for his People.

It's but a turn of his hand, a ſhine of his face, and look of his countenance, and we are ſaved. And he is a ſure, ſteady, and faithful help, that will ſtand by us to the end, and in the end. And have not our ſouls had plentiful experience? and is there any thing that can more fortifie and ſtrengthen faith,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62588:123"/>than the remembrances of his paſt ſuccours? <hi>Pſa.</hi> 61.3, 4. Oh therefore perſwade we our ſouls (by all theſe twiſted Arguments) and lay them under a perpetual and irrevocable obligation to hope in the Lord. O you that are young men, you that are old men (for the Pſalmiſt calls on all ſorts of men to truſt in the Lord) you that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, make him the hope of your youth; and you that are going out of the world, make him the ſtaff of your age: You can never truſt God too much, nor the Creature too little. Hope in him for your bodies, for your ſouls, in good daies, in evil, under private evils, under publick. Are you caſt into a troubleſome world, (as indeed you are in this preſent generation) go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sea in a ſtorm, never ſuch a ruffle in the world, yet caſt your Anchor on God. When your credits, eſtates, liberties, health, wealth, trade, religion, your all lies at the ſtake, ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him. In times of greateſt hurlyburly, diſtraction and confuſion, yet be found waiting for him and his ſalvation. Were you in priſon, in exile, in a wilderneſs, do not deſpair, Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is with his People whereſoever they are caſt: God can be with you in a priſon, as he was with <hi>Joſeph;</hi> in a dungeon, as with <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> in a Lions den, as with <hi>Daniel;</hi> nay, if you were in Hell with <hi>Jonas,</hi> he can make it an Heaven to you. God is with his to the end of the Earth; he can ſupply all your wants, even ſpread a table for you in the wilderneſs, relieve all your ſtraits, rid you out of all your dangers, deliver you from all your fears, do for you beyond your thoughts, deſires or hopes. Should, or does it go ill with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62588:123"/>Sion? are the Church and People of God low? do her enemies grow high, inſolent and triumph? Is the Church upon the Cockboat of diſtractions? are there great diſorders and confuſions abroad, diviſions and unſettlements at home, impediments in the way of reformation, ſo as ye look for peace, and no good comes, and for healing, but behold a time of trouble; go to God who governs the world, and the Church too. He ſteers the ſhip, and though now toſſed with the tempeſtuous waves of animoſity, pride, and contention, will yet command a calm, and bring it ſafely to ſhore. Deliverance ſhall come the way he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the day he hath determined too, if not this or that, yet another day, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. He hath made a ſtanding promiſe, that no weapon formed againſt her ſhall proſper, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. And though <hi>Gebal, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck,</hi> ſhould joyn together their heads, hearts and hands, and unite in never ſo many deep contrivances, cloſe conſpiracies, and factious cunning ſtratagems, bold and daring attempts, ſtrong combinations: Though Papiſts and Atheiſts, Jews, Turks and Devils, ſhould all enter a league and confederacy, yet ſhall they be broken: though they dig as deep as Hell, the counſels of Heaven would undermine them, and divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence counterwork them (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.15. Though they lay the train of never ſo cruel and politick a deſign, God would blow it up, and return the bliſters upon their own faces. In the worſt of times, it's your duty to hope for better; <hi>baec non durabunt aetatem.</hi> God will give theſe an end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he will create on every dwelling place of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62588:124"/>Mount Sion ('tis a Goſpel-promiſe) and upon her Aſſemblies a cloud, and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night (as he did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, to whoſe pillar of cloud and fire the Prophet alludes.) For upon all the glory ſhall be a defence. And though there be never ſo many lets in the way of mercy, God is able to turn hinderances into furtherances, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into medicines, deſtructions into deliverances. O therefore at all times and ſeaſons, in all caſes and conditions, go to God as your help and hope. And if you would know how to make your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him, and at what ſpecial times and ſeaſons you ſhould hope and depend upon him, take a ſhort account in a few particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What are the ſpecial ſeaſons we ſhould go to God in? I anſwer, no time is amiſs. There is as welcome going to God in a Sun-ſhine, as in a ſtorm. There is no time of addreſſe to God, but 'tis an accepted time. There may be a time when God will not be found, but never any when he will not be ſought. In time of felicity, when we ſit under the warming influence of gracious providence, God ſpreads a table for us, and our cups overflow with his goodneſs: This is one of the moſt noble, but yet one of the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult exerciſes of faith. When a man enjoys the fulneſs of the creature, yet to reſt purely upon the Creator. It was an high pitch of <hi>Paul,</hi> when having nothing, yet to be as having all things; but yet a far higher attainment, when having all things, yet to be as having nothing: This is one of the ſublimeſt acts faith can poſſibly exert. But the ordinary uſe of hope is in daies of adverſity,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62588:124"/>when the ſoul eats the bread of carefulneſs, and drinks the wine of aſtoniſhment. When the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come into his ſoul, and all Gods billows are ready to cover him, and ſwallow him up. A tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt is the ſeaſonable time for the Believer to throw out the anchor of his hope; eſpecially when a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Under purſuits of divine wrath. Gods terrours drink up his ſpirit; his arrows ſtick faſt in him, and his hand preſſeth him very fore. While God is killing, his people ſhould be truſting. There's no way (under thoſe) but of running from God, unto God, from the bar of his Juſtice, to the Throne of his Grace; from him as an angry Judge, to him as a reconciled Father, from him as the deſtroyer of ſinners, to him as the Saviour of ſouls, and preſerver of his creatures. As the Malefactor fled to the City of Refuge, crying all along as he went, Refuge, Refuge, ſo ſhould the ſoul fly to God either under the pourings out of perſonal wrath, as the Prodigal to his Father, or offender to the Judge for pardon; or under the popular executions of his wrath on the world, as a Wife flies to her Husband for protection. When God is coming out againſt the world with ſword, fire, famine, or peſtilence, then 'tis our wiſdom to repair to him, who is an harbour in every tempeſt, a ſhelter in every ſtorm, a ſanctuary wherein the ſoul may ſecurely hide and repoſe under every ſtroke of divine vengeance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Under the oppreſſions of Satan, or oppoſitions of humane violence. Go as beggars to the Throne of Grace, to beg help in that time of need. When the Kite comes, get under the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62588:125"/>wings of Gods Providence and preſence. So Did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 57.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.8. <hi>I fly to thee to hide me:</hi> Thus <hi>Luther, I will goe and tell my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the failure and diſappointment of all Creatures, when all ſecond Cauſes fail, then 'tis time to go to the firſt, and when the arm of fleſh breaks, then to lay hold on the Father of Spirits. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 73.23. — and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. when he had loſt his wives, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in God as his husband. So the Church, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17. — As Gods ſolemn appearances for us, engage us to truſt in Him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>ult. Then they believed the Lord, and his ſervant</hi> Moſes. So do the Creatures appearances againſt us, and diſcouragements to us. This was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s concluſion of Faith, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Upon Impoſition, or undertaking of extraordinary burdens, whether of ſervice or ſuffering. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> goes to God for Eloquence when he was to go in to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and become his accuſer and Gods advocate, ſpokeſman for <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> going out againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> went out in the Name of the Lord, and <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when to combat with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> beggs help from Heaven. Our Saviour falls earneſtly to Prayer when about to ſuffer. New ſervices call for new Supplies, and great ſufferings propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable ſtrength and ſupport to carry us through them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Under falls into deep and ſore afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtreſſes: As under ſurprizals by fears and dangers (what time we are afraid, truſting in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62588:125"/>him) ſo under the feeling of piercing afflictions. <hi>In my diſtreſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I cried to the Lord, and out of the depths he heard me.</hi> When the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt Soul cannot ſwim to ſhore, yet let him cry for help. The end God brings us into afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is that they might bring us to himſelf, that we might not truſt in our ſelves, but in him the living God. In times of perſonal diſtreſs or Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, wants, weakneſſes, ſickneſſes, ſcandals, confinements, baniſhments from our houſe and home, and native ſoil, yea under the moſt cruel perſecutions, by tongue or hand, we may appeal with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> to Heaven, and have right done us. When the Soul is like <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the top of theſe waters, it may reſt on God's holy Mountain. Thus we finde the Church betaking her ſelf to God, in an ill time, a time of general corruption, ſore oppreſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme depopulation, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. though it was foul under feet, ſhe hopes to finde it fair above head; and while ſhe found nothing but a lour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Earth, preſumes to ſpye a ſimiling Heaven. Our Saviour bids us, not in glorious times, but ſad, not hang down, but lift up our heads, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Under dying apprehenſions. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> flyes to Gods Covenant, and confirms by the freſh atteſtations of his Faith his Viſion with, and intereſt in his God, when to take his leave and farewell of all worldly intereſts, and the union between his body and ſoul was to receive its diſſolution. So holy <hi>Job</hi> when marching out of the world, goes out to his Redeemer. There is no ſuch time as a dying hour, to truſt in the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:62588:126"/>living God. And ſo much ſhortly to that firſt Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How muſt we make our addreſſes to God ſo as in an evil day to finde help from him: Eſpecially theſe five manner of wayes: Firſt, By Soul-abaſement and humiliation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our own unworthineſs and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, that we are leſs than the leaſt of all Gods mercies, unworthy any crumm that falls from his Providential Table. Indeed as long as we can ſtand upon our own leggs, we will not go to God. (The Childe as long as he can maintain himſelf, will not come home to his Father,) but when we are fallen, then we are glad of help: This is that hath always obtained with God for particular mercy and publick ſalvation; and hath been the conſtant carriage and behaviour of his people in their addreſſes to him, though they come to him boldly as to a Father, yet withall humbly as to their King. Thus the Centurion, <hi>I am not worthy thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof.</hi> Thus the Prodigal, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt thee, and againſt Heaven:</hi> So the Woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, Truth Lord, the dogs,</hi> &amp;c. So in publick ſuits, <hi>Abraham</hi> comes not with duſt and aſhes on his head only, but in his mouth alſo, when a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor for <hi>Sodom. Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> preſent themſelves with great humiliation before God, when praying for the people. So the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when captivated by <hi>Shiſhak</hi> humble themſelves, and ſay, <hi>the Lord is righteous,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6, 7. and ſo the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. When ſhe ſtirs up her ſelf to take hold upon God, ſhe confeſſeth he had hid his face from her for her
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62588:126"/>ſins, and conſumed her for her iniquities. <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiſeth up them that be bowed down,</hi> Pſal. 145.14. If we would finde acceptance with God, we muſt go to him, as that good King, <hi>Lord, we know not what to doe.</hi> Lord, I am under ſuch a guilt, under ſuch a temptation, under ſuch a want, or affliction, and I know not what to doe, but mine eyes are towards thee. And that's the ſecond, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of all Creature-helps, and carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences: God never loves to give his people mercy, till they know not where to have it elſe; when they know not what to do, then he will let them know what he can do. Thus the Church goes to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23, 24.— and <hi>cap.</hi> 14.22. and ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13.— When all our Ciſterns are dried up, then is a fit time for God to open the windows of Heaven. If we would have Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>help we muſt deny our ſelves, and diſclaim all creature-props, and ſtayes, ordinances, duties, graces, priviledges, and if outward help, we muſt abandon all Creature-dependencies. The hand muſt be firſt emptied, that receives any gifts of grace and mercy from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By Prayer and Invocation. Its Gods promiſe in leading his people to their reſting place, that <hi>with weeping and ſupplications he would lead them,</hi> Jer. 31.9. <hi>Aſa</hi> in his great ſtrait goes to God by Prayer, and beggs and implores help, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. <hi>He cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, Help us, O Lord our God.</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah, Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for me.</hi> The Apoſtle directs us to the throne of grace for help, which <hi>Paul</hi> attending found this anſwer, <hi>My grace is ſufficient.</hi> Prayer
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62588:127"/>is the bucket of Heaven. It's the Pſalmiſts little River in the City of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. At which come up all the ſouls goods. <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me,</hi> Pſal. 34.4. <hi>Then ſhall ye pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me— and I will give you an expecied end,</hi> Jer. 29. <hi>For all theſe things I will be inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 36.37. Prayer is the condition of mercy: We muſt call, though we never ſo fully expect. If we ſtop our mouths, God will ſtop his hand; and leave off asking, God will leave off giving and granting. Sometimes God is found of thoſe who ſeek him not, <hi>(poteſt inveniri, non perveniri)</hi> as to the firſt grace, but having once given his Spirit, he will be ſought of all that finde him. Prayer is <hi>vehiculum divinae miſericordiae,</hi> the Chariot in which the King of Heaven comes down graciouſly into our ſouls. Prayer indeed cannot haſten mercy as to Gods time, but it may as to ours; not as to the time he hath appointed (but his Promiſe being conditional) it may as to the time by us expected. And the aſſurance of mercy ſhould not prevent duty, but enforce it: the certainty of the end, eſtabliſheth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the uſe of the means. If we would have mercy from God, we muſt not be too proud or ſhameface't to beg it, but take words with us, and ſay, <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.</hi> When we are laid by affliction flat on our backs, then have we a fit opportunity to look up to Heaven, and ſay, Behold us, O Lord, look upon us, and our afflictions, remember the troubles and ſorrows of our hearts, come and heal us, and help us; for thou alone art our ſtay and truſt, our ſuccour and ſupport, our prop
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62588:127"/>and pillar, our only help and hope. God hath made many large and excellent promiſes to prayer under perſonal, and alſo publick calamities, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. <hi>If my people pray</hi> — And <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> urgeth this promiſe in prayer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.9. <hi>If when evil comes on us — and we cry to thee in our affliction, then hear and help.</hi> God knows how to give out mercy, but he will have this homage of us, firſt to ask, and then will not, cannot deny, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Quanto magis?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, By faith and believing. He that ſpeeds in his acceſſes muſt believe. As prayer muſt be made, ſo faith muſt be acted. He gives grace and glory to them that truſt in him. Faith trades at Heaven, and fetcheth in large incomes of mercy. Prayer may knock and beg for mercy, but ſaith receives it, though not as <hi>manus laborantis,</hi> yet, <hi>mendicantis.</hi> An unbeliever can receive nothing from the Lord. Faith is to prayer, as fire to pouder; the piece will not off without it, nor make any report. Without faith wings it, prayer can never reach Heaven, and therefore not bring down any thing thence. Prayer is the ſhip, but faith the wind, whereby we muſt ſail to the cape of good hope. Faith without prayer, is but a bold <hi>bravado,</hi> or daring preſumption; Prayer without faith, is but a beating the Air, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſound, or vain canting in the ears of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By returning reſolutions. He that would come to God, ſo as to obtain mercy, muſt reſolve ſo to come, as never to depart from him more by iniquity. <hi>O Iſrael, return to the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>from whom thou haſt fallen,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62588:128"/>So <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Behold I frame evil, and deviſe a device againſt you, return you now every man from his evil way, and make your waies and your doings good.</hi> There is no coming to God to beg only further liberty of ſinning againſt him. <hi>I will hear,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, what God will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his People, and his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly.</hi> God will never beſtow his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us, to make it only a fomentation to our corruption. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> kept cloſe to God, then he helped them when in all their ſtraits and calamities they called upon him; but when they rebelled againſt him, he gave them up into the hand of the Nations. Surely his ſalvation is nigh them that fear him, and keep his Covenant; a penitent, humble, obedient frame, is requiſite in all our approaches to Heaven; a turning to God with faſting, weeping and mourning, a reſolve to offer him the calves of our lips. The Prophet hath it excellently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.12. We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, return and come. Such approaches to God alwaies are welcome to him, and ſucceſsful to his People. That's the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is a ground of ſatisfaction and acquieſcence to the People of God. His help may be ſufficient to give our ſouls contentment under all the fails or wants of the creature. The Apoſtle (in that holy paradox) bids us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for nothing, not anxiouſly — but in every thing make our requeſts known to God with prayer and thankſgiving — <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. Duty and ſervice is our work, care and providence Gods. The child takes no care, becauſe he hath a Father to provide for him; nor is the Wife ſollicitous,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62588:128"/>becauſe ſhe is provided for by her Husband; we muſt not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, diſtract our hearts with need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fears and cares about worldly reliefs or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was our Saviours caution, let not your hearts be roiled, as waters with ſtirring, or troubled, as a ſhip with toſſing. <hi>Nec habeo, careo, aut curo,</hi> may be the Chriſtians Motto. We ſhould not envy wicked mens ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when as we have an intereſt in Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency; nor neceſſitate him for lower bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, when he hath given us the better part. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jacob</hi> was brought to an excellent pitch of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, upon his experience and obſervation of providence, when he vowed to God, that if God would be with him, and keep him in the way he was to go, and give him but bread to eat, and rayment to put on, then the Lord ſhould be his God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. If God gives us neceſſaries, why ſhould we ſtand on ſuperfluities? Let me ask thy ſoul (Chriſtian) but this one queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldeſt part with thy hope of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in thy God for all the world? And if God hath given thee the beſt things, why ſhouldeſt thou doubt or diſtruſt his providence for the worſt? why doubt ye, O ye of little faith? does God provide for Ravens, and will he not provide for his Sons and Daughters? he that feeds the Sparrows, and cloaths the Lillies, will never ſee his children ſtarve or periſh. It's ſtrange to ſee how carnal men can truſt their Mammon of the world, and yet Chriſtians cannot truſt the ever-living God. Strange, that we can truſt God with our ſouls, and yet hardly truſt him with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. This ſpeaks a living by ſenſe, more than
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62588:129"/>by ſaith: ſtrange, that we could truſt him before we knew him in a way of gracious acquaintance with him; and now doubt him, when we have had ſuch plentiful experience of him? They who know his Name ſhould truſt in him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This laies a juſt ground for return unto God for all receipts of help and influence from him. Grace ſhould aſcend, where it does deſcend; priviledge asks ſervice. <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.12. It was charged on <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he returned not to the Lord according to the benefit done to him (the help af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him againſt the King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi>) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. But who can give to the Lord? or what can man be profitable to his Maker? Indeed we have nothing worthy his acceptance; all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have no further value in them, than what grace puts upon them: as gilded and enamel'd with his gracious acceptation in Chriſt, ſo they become only beautiful and precious in his ſight. But though God expects no full compenſation, he doth a right and juſt improvement. And there is but a twofold way of improvement. By ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advance of Gods honour and glory, and communicating to the wants and neceſſities of our Brethren.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For Gods glory. Does the Lord help us? it's but reaſonable we ſhould help him. Let us help him againſt the mighty: but God ſtands in no need of our help; he will maintain his own cauſe, we may let God alone to govern the world: yet we finde God himſelf once asking the queſtion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.16. <hi>Who ſhall riſe up for me againſt the evil deers? who ſhall ſtand up for me againſt the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62588:129"/>workers of iniquity?</hi> Who is on my ſide? who? The cauſe and intereſt of God ſometimes is leaning, ſeems falling; and though God does not need our help, yet he ſometime requires it, not chuſing to act in a more immediate way, but like the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſtands and looks on, while his men do his work. And we may be aſſured, God will take it very heinouſly, if we ſee it carted for want of putting to our ſhoulders. O let us then be zealous for God, and appear for his cauſe; truth and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; appear in our places againſt ſin, and for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. As we would ever have God appear for us at the laſt day, when he comes out againſt the world; ſo let us appear for God in our day, when the world are going out againſt him. With what face or confidence dare we look God in the face at judgement, and deſire him to ſtand then by us, when our conſciences ſhall accuſe us? Time was when we would not ſtand by him, or venture any thing for him, and tell us withall, that he that denies Chriſt before men, he will deny before his Father in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For our Brethrens ſupply. As we have received, ſo let us communicate. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to other poor ſouls that need our help. When converted our ſelves, we ought to ſtrengthen our Brethren. The world is for uſe, not for enjoyment, grace for both: We are not owners, only Stewards of thoſe talents God hath concredited, and he will expect an account of us, according to our receipts ought to be our diſburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and never did any ſoul loſe by his layings out for God, but he ſufficiently reimburſed him. The liquor of mercy is on purpoſe put by God
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62588:130"/>into broken Veſſels, that it might run out to others. We ſhould do what in us lies to hand Chriſt and Grace, thoſe gifts of God to our Brethren; our Lamps ſhould be filled with Oyl, that others might borrow of us, at leaſt light from us. It was <hi>Jobs</hi> commendation, that he was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; he fed them with his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, cloathed them with his raiment, harboured them in his houſe, <hi>Job</hi> 31. It's much more our duty to endeavour the illumination of blind minds, and recovery of lame ſouls, and help them by the crutches of our prayers, tears, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, who cannot as yet ſtep without them. If our neighbours beaſt be in the ditch, we ought to help him out, and much more his ſoul, when about plunging into Hell. When one neighbours houſe is on fire, all the neighbour-hood will contribute their beſt ability to quench it, and ſhall we not lend our helping-hand to extinguiſh the flames of divine wrath, which our Brothers ſoul hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled upon him, and wherein he is like to burn elſe to all eternity? And as graceleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſtand in need of our help, ſo oftentimes do comfortleſs Saints; they are weary and heavy laden, and would be glad of a lift at their burden. To a man afflicted, pity ſhould be ſhown of his friend. No truer ſign of grace than a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſenſe of the wounds of a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and no ſurer ſign of a deſperate mind, devoted to deſtruction, than a want of ſympathy with them. The end God comforts us, is, that we may comfort others? 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. And he expects, being our ſelves converted, we ſhould ſtrengthen our Brethren; we ſhould not be ciſterns, to keep
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62588:130"/>all in, but conduits to let run out our gifts, graces and experiences to others. It's the rareſt Art in the world, to comfort afflicted conſciences; every Chriſtian ſhould endeavour to be well skill'd in it. By diſtributions of grace and comfort to others, we ſhall become gainers, and loſe no more than the Sun does of light, or the Fountain of water, by affording us their beams and ſtreams. <hi>Virtus eundo creſcit.</hi> Natural motions may ſpend, but this ſpiritual increaſeth. It's pity the talents of grace ſhould ever lie dead by us, and ſuch holy uſury and improvement alwaies brings in the greateſt increaſe, and largeſt revenue. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Chriſtian hath no more grace, than he well improves for Gods glory, and his own and others good. And as we muſt communicate to others ſouls, ſo to their outward conditions too that need our help. <hi>Feed the hungry, cloath the naked</hi>—As we have opportunity, do good to all men, with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed. <hi>Charge them</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that are rich, that they be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to diſtribute — And he that hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his Brother need, and hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> The merciful is bleſſed, and he ſhall finde mercy, but let him never expect mercy from God, that hath no mercy for man. God will one day ſhut his heart as cloſe as ever he did his purſe, and ſtraiten his bowels to him, as he did his bounty to his Brethren. The bill at the laſt day runs in negatives, and God will cauſe both the gallant and worldly muck-worm, ſhortly to know, that he gave them eſtates, not to lay out on their backs and bellies; and monies, not barely to trade with,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62588:131"/>and treaſure up for their followers, but to do good with in their generations by acts of piety and charity as occaſion was offered them. Chriſt will go on the other ſide from their Souls ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, who now paſſed on the other ſide with a bare naked view of their Brethrens bleeding condition. It was good <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> glory, That he did not oppreſs the poor, but relieve them. It will be a fearfull cry againſt rich hoarders at the laſt day, which all the cravings, and ſtarvings of the poor amongſt them will ſend out againſt them. The Apoſtle gives us a report of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled is to viſit the fatherleſs and widow, and to keep a mans ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted in the World.</hi> It's reported of the Deer, that they in ſwimming over a River help each other by leaning on one anothers backs, and when the formoſt be weary he comes hindmoſt. And the ſtory of the Belly in the Fable is not unknown. So ſhould we help each other in our paſſage to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Let this be a ground of confidence in God under all trialls and troubles; let us not caſt away our confidence, for it hath a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore ſhall have great recompenſe of reward: Let us not deſpond, but depend on God for help in all our ſtraits: <hi>lift up our eyes to the heavens, whence cometh our help,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.1, 2. Not that we ſhould not make uſe of all lawfull means, under trouble, and do like him (who being plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ditch, would not ſtirre, but ſtay till God helpt him out). This is to tempt God, and not to truſt him. <hi>Qui vitat molam, vitat farinam.</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:62588:131"/>Reliance on the firſt Cauſe deſtroyes not the uſe of the ſecond. There is a great deal of difference between uſing of means and reſting on them: As it's evil to uſe means, and not reſt on God, (this is carnal confidence) ſo it's vain to depend on God out of the uſe of Means, (that's daring preſumption). Though God hath determin'd all ſtates, conditions and changes, notwithſtanding his decrees, a man may ſtaive for want of food, and die for want of Phyſick too. God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed neceſſary means in order to ſuch and ſuch ends, and he that would obtain the mercy God hath promiſed, muſt uſe the means he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But notwithſtanding this Caution, we muſt not ſo look down on the Valley, as not withall, yea, chiefly and principally to look up to the Hills, nor ſo view Earth, as not in the mean time (with that Cardinal) to have leiſure to look up to Heaven. O 'tis a ſweet thing to ſee our mercies and ſupplies coming from Gods right hand, and dropping to us from Heaven. Happy it is in all conditions to have a God to fly to, and to incourage our ſelves in. When we are reduced to great ſtraits, and all the World ſeems to be in an uproar, and blended in a Chaos of confuſion, and we are amuzed and amazed, then to have a God to repoſe and confide in, is an infinite mercy. O learn we to truſt and hope in this our God at all times: Who would not truſt this God, who is ſo able and ſo ready to help? Truſt him for your ſelves, with your Bodies, your Eſtates, your Souls, your all: Truſt him for the Church; truſt him in time of mens fierceſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62588:132"/>truſt him in time of his own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate viſitations.</p>
            <p>But it may be you will object and ſay, we are unworthy of any ſuch help or influence, and therefore cannot put forth ſuch confidence. But remember, God do's all for his people <hi>gratis,</hi> all graciouſly from firſt to laſt, for his Names ſake: He blots out iniquities, heals backſlidings, repairs his peoples breaches, and all for his Names ſake. Take one place for all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.9. <hi>For my Names ſake will I deferre mine anger</hi>— This is the grand argument Gods people inſiſt on in all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for mercy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.— <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. And the flagg of defiance he hung out, and the ſtanding challenge he made to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in all his Benefactions to them, <hi>Not for your ſakes</hi>— Conſideration of our unworthineſs (if ſenſible of it, and rightly affected with it) is ſo far from being a diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it ſhould be to us rather an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to come to God on all occaſions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our ſpiritual, or our temporal eſtates and conditions. God is worthy to give, and will not ſay as <hi>Alexander</hi> once, when one asked him a groat, that that was too little for a King to give, and a talent too much for a Beggar to receive, but will give like a King, like a God, though we be never ſo unworthy to receive. Free grace delights to triumph in ſinners unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>But it may be, unbelief will object and ſay, It's in vain, we have waited a long time upon the Lord for help, and none comes, for ſtrength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a temptation, for comfort under ſuch an affliction, for deliverance out of ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62588:132"/>ſtraits and trialls, for ſalvation for his Church and people, but yet no ſign of his coming, the Chariot-wheels of mercy draw heavily: God hath forſaken us, there is no hope, why ſhould we wait on the Lord any longer? Notwithſtanding all this (my Soul) It's good to hope, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wait for the ſalvation of the Lord.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this cavil, conſider but, Firſt, That God do's not always work according to our plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. We would chalk out the way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> preſcribe to Omnipotency and Eternity for the time and manner of our deliverance: but this is to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our laſt, over-ſawcy boldneſs, and malepert preſumption. Who art thou O man, that wouldſt ſit at God's Councel-table, or become his Director? Shall the Clay preſcribe to the Potter his way of workmanſhip? God do's all things in infinite wiſdom and holineſs, and works all things according to the Counſel of his own will. God indeed is a ſure help to his People, yet he do's not always help them, perfectly, viſibly, or preſently.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Not perfectly, mercy is at firſt an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, and Infant, before it comes to any ſtature and proportion. The motions of Providence are great (God is doing many things at once, and one deſign is lodged in the boſom of another) and therefore ſlow, though ſure. Providence is forced to ride circuit, go farre about, before it can effect and accompliſh Gods intended purpoſes; and oft the furtheſt way about proves the neereſt home. We muſt not (as <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay) judge of God's Comical Tragedies before the laſt act.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62588:133"/>The Picture though a rude draught at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Limner hath done with it, becomes a poliſhed piece. God do's (as that famous Painter anſwered, when he was taxed for his tediouſneſs in drawing <hi>Venus</hi>'s Picture) <hi>aeternitati pingere,</hi> carries on a deſign for Eternity, by all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent revolutions of Providence, which though the blinde World cannot now behold the beauty of, yet at the laſt day will appear glorious to the view of men and Angels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Not viſibly. Gods Providence oft, when it works for a man, ſeems to work againſt him. <hi>Jacob</hi> thought all things were againſt him, when all went well on his ſide. It was a good obſervation of <hi>Luther,</hi> that God uſeth to work by contraries for his Church, to bring light out of darkneſs, and Heaven out of Hell. Gods ways are often in the Deep, and his paths hidden and unknown. <hi>Thou hideſt thy ſelf, O God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Saviour.</hi> The Devil firſt comes with the ſweeteſt, and at laſt with the ſharpeſt; God on the contrary makes a ſad beginning, but a bleſſed and comfortable end. — <hi>ye have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> God indeed uſually comes to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked firſt with a bleſſing, and laſt with a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to his people firſt with a judgement, and laſt with a bleſſing. The wicked have the top of the Cup of mercy, but the dregs of that of wrath: The Saints ſip of the Cup of wrath, but have the bottom of that of mercy. Now the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off the approaches of mercy are, the more inviſible. The Prophet ſpeaks of the <hi>Interſtitium</hi> between the Law, and the Goſpel, that it ſhould be a day half dark and half light, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62588:133"/>And 'tis alwayes darkeſt and coldeſt a little before break of day: We are no competent Judges of divine operations. God was in that place, and <hi>Jacob</hi> knew it not; we often fear a Devil of fury, when, there's nothing but an Angel of mercy, and look not on that ſide of the Picture, which hath the face of a beautifull Virgin, but the other that hath the affrighting look of an ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Monſter. <hi>Manoah,</hi> when God came to viſit him, thought he came to murder him: when God comes to comfort us, then we are well-pleaſed, but let him come to humble, refine and purge, better and reform us, then we cry out Undone. We are ſenſible when he gives us fuller aſſurance, but not when he works in us more holineſs. So let Chriſt appear in his glory in his Church, let him give her a Year of Jubilee, then her Children lift up their heads; but let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the prefiguring ſigns, and ſhake all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, come with Fire and Sword, then mens hearts tremble for fear, and ſcarce is faith to be found in the Earth. But the infinitely wiſe God hath private Channels and Conveyances of grace, which are not a whit leſs ſure, becauſe more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſecret.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, not preſently. As God works not according to our modell, ſo he takes his own time. That leads to the ſecond. He alwayes obſerves not, nay ſeldom or never our time. Chriſt would do nothing before his hour came. It is not for us to know the times and ſeaſons which God hath reſerved in his own Power. <hi>All things ſhall</hi> (not do at preſent) <hi>work together for good;</hi> take the whole piece, when finiſht, and it will appear
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62588:134"/>excellent. God hath an appointed time, which once come, mercy ſhall ſtay no longer. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. The very ſame day Iſrael went out of</hi> Egypt <hi>by their armies.</hi> In that inſtant <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying, the ſeventy weeks being determined, comes a Dove with a Letter in its wing, an Angel flying to him with intelligence of the return of their Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. There is a ſet time when he will have mercy on <hi>Sion.</hi> God ſent his Son in the fulneſs of time. When the <hi>Ammorites</hi> ſins be full, he will judge them, though it be four hundred years firſt, he had not forgotten them; one day with him is as a thouſand, and a thouſand years but as yeſterday, as a Watch in the night. And when Gods peoples graces be at the full, he will then come and ſave them. He gathers his fruit when once ripe. God does not alwayes ride poſt, or mercy come on the wing, but though it be long firſt, it ſhall ſurely come at laſt, and the longer in coming, the better and more welcom; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſoon ripe are ſoon rotten, ſoon gotten ſoon loſt; but thoſe which coſt us dear, and are the fruit of many prayers, tears and ſorrows, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of much faith and hope, waiting and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are ſweeteſt and ſureſt, our <hi>Benjamins</hi> and moſt beloved darlings. God hath bound himſelf by promiſe to his people for the thing, but not for the time, and he does not therefore obſerve the ſooneſt but the ſeaſonableſt time, nor ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider our need, as not alſo to reſpect our fitneſs, and ſo his own glory. He can work when he pleaſeth: <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi</hi>— and if he does not when we deſire, it's but a juſt requital; for as his time was not ours in coming to him,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62588:134"/>ſo 'tis but equal our time ſhould not be his in coming to us. But yet his delaies are no denials, and mercy may be neareſt, when it ſeems furtheſt off: Faith knows Gods time is the beſt, and is willing to ſtay for its portion, till he pleaſeth to pay it; alwaies ſaying, <hi>Not mine, but thy will be done.</hi> If God comes not <hi>ad horam,</hi> he will <hi>ad ſalutem:</hi> the longer the Phyſick remains in the body of the Patient, the more effectual will be its operation: And the longer the veſſel of prayer be gone, the greater lading it brings with it, when it once comes home. Haſty births com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly miſcarry, and how ſad a caſe will it be to loſe a mercy, or have it ſpoiled, and have half a mercy inſtead of it, for want of a little longer waiting? The Souldier will be vexed to purpoſe, if he delivers the Caſtle, when as if he had ſtaid but a few daies longer, relief had come certainly. What gat <hi>Saul</hi> by poſting the Sacrifice before <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> came? It might have cut him to the heart, if it did not to think, that had he waited but a few daies longer, he had ſaved both his life and his Kingdom. Impatience hath loſt or impaired many a mercy. God will grant our patient, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſubmiſſive requeſts, but never in mercy our reſtleſs and too importunate deſires. Theſe make him often give us royal favours in anger, and let his wrath enter our ſouls, while yet our meat is in our mouths. The Church had learnt better manners, than to be ſo haſty, ſo quick and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. <hi>In the way of thy Judgements have we waited for thee.</hi> It's too great a boldneſs to make our watch a rule for Gods Sun; our ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtructions often uſher in our deliverance,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62588:135"/>and our too great haſte for deliverance oft proves our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, We may ſay, our caſe is ſad, our miſery great, we are under ſore trials and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have met with many diſappointments, ſo as we have no hope, our caſe is deſperate, our diſeaſe is grown incurable. To which I anſwer, the ſadder our condition, the more hope. The greater mans miſery, the more Gods pity, and deeper our affliction, the higher his affection. It's the more honour to God to work, when others have thrown it up; and the greater glory to this heavenly Phyſitian to do the cure when 'tis grown <hi>opprobrium medicorum,</hi> the ſcorn to all others. God delights to come in at a ſtrait, to know his People in a day of adverſity: To ſtay till all our power be gone, our hope periſhed, and we have given over praying, ſeeking, waiting, hoping and expecting, and given up all for loſt, that ſo he may have wherewithall to ſet all his Attributes on work at once; his power, wiſdom, goodneſs and mercy. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had committed a great ſin, yet <hi>Ezra</hi> comforts them with this, There is yet hope in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Art thou troubled with the guilt of ſin, defilement, and power of corruption? art thou diſturbed with fears, doubts, temptations? doſt thou want the evidence of Gods favour, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aſſurances of his love? art thou preſſed down with the weight of thy afflictions? do thy feet ſtick in the mire, and thy ſoul is born down, and ſinks through the load that is upon thy ſhoulders? yet look up by faith to Heaven; God can open a door of hope in this valley of <hi>Achor.</hi> Lo he is behind the curtain, though thou ſeeſt him not, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62588:135"/>will ſtep in and help thee, if he ſees the ſwoon or faint. He is <hi>praeſto,</hi> ready at hand to ſave thee; though he ſeems to ſleep, he and his arm can awake (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9.) as a mighty man out of ſleep, for his enemies confuſion, and eke his Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. He will ariſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>ult.</hi> He can turn thy captivity as the ſtreams of the South, and a word of his mouth ſhall do it, as well as an act of his hand. Be not diſcouraged or deſpondent, but wait his approach. Though thy heart fail, be of good courage; and he will ſtrengthen thine heart. Thou haſt an omnipotent arm to lean upon, therefore give not in, nor give over. Still be found in the way of thy duty, pray ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, wait ſtill, and for ever hope in the Lord and his mercy. God oft ſuggeſts his Creatorſhip in Scripture to encourage his People in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. As to <hi>Jacob, Iſa.</hi> 40.27, 28. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124. <hi>ult. Our help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</hi> And thus in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pſalm, in the words following the Text: Which made Heaven and Earth, to teach us, that God can do any thing, who made all things. What is it God cannot do, as well as he did create the world out of nothing? What ſhould we doubt in his way of providence, whoſe power we have ſuch demonſtrative proof of in the work of creation? And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to make that relation ſpeak mercy too, as well as power, and goodneſs as greatneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. Where he exhorts Saints in a ſuffering condition, to commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well doing, as into the hand of a faithful Creator. This title alone ſpeaks comfort and aſſurance to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:62588:136"/>Gods People, and abundant incouragement to wait and hope in him: not crying out in their paſſions, I ſhall one day fall by the hand of this evil; but ſtaying themſelves on him in the worſt of humane miſeries and calamities. Let me leave it with this <hi>Memento,</hi> That thy condition is not ſuch, neither can ever any ſuch ſtate befall thee, that either God hath not holpen in, or cannot help in. No temptations betide thee, but what are common to the Saints; and ſhould there, God can do that he never did, as well as thou need that none ever had; and being thy God and Creator, thou mayeſt be ſure his help ſhall alway be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to thy needs, for he will not forſake the work of his hands. He can work, and none ſhall let him. He that ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was ſo in the world,</hi> can ſay, Let there be grace, peace, comfort, and there ſhall be ſo in the heart; Let there be truth and peace, and there ſhall be ſo in the Church. If God be your help, then make him your hope in all conditions and caſes, publick or private. Hath God broken your eſtates, your families, or man ruined them? God can repair them: Hath he broken his Church and People, broken down her hedge, ſo that the Boar of the Wood doth waſte her, and all the wild beaſts of the Forreſt devour her? he can yet look down upon her, and raiſe her up when loweſt, and throw down her enemies when higheſt. Let the houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> yea, and all that fear the Lord, truſt in the Lord, and ye that have no helper, make him your hope and help. Say, This God is our God, and ſhall be our guide to death. I ſhall diſmiſs this branch of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62588:136"/>Application, with an anſwer to theſe two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What are the conditions upon which we may challenge help from God in an evil day?</p>
            <p>Secondly, What are the times and ſeaſons when we may moſt confidently expect it? All evils are reduceable to two general heads. They are either Gods immediate viſitations, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane afflictions and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rſecutions. The former of theſe I ſhall anſwer with ſpecial reference to the firſt, the latter to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Firſt, On what terms may Gods People expect help, when he is going out in the way of his Judgements, as Sword, Peſtilence, &amp;c? I ſhall but name theſe five conditions, (the diſcourſe being ſwoln far beyond what it was intended.)</p>
            <p>Firſt, A religious ſeverity, which conſiſts in an accurate walking before God in a day of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and mercy; a ſetting ſtrait ſteps to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a cleaving to him, a dwelling in him as our habitation, a maintaining ſtrict and cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. The effect of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, quietneſs and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever. Communion with God in a good day, layes a ſure foundation for confidence in him in an evil. He that remembers God in his high eſtate, God will remember him in his low; that makes God his ſong in Sun-ſhine daies, ſhall finde him his ſtrength in tempeſtuous times; who give God a room in their hearts and houſes in times of felicity, ſhall have room in his Ark in the day of adverſity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.8, 9. <hi>Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord;</hi> he was a juſt man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his generations, and walked with God.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62588:137"/>Whereas, they who forſake God in the time of mercy, he will forſake them in the time of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; thoſe who now turn the back on him, he will then turn the face from, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.17. As they gave a deaf ear to the voice of his mercy, ſhutting the door of their hearts to him, he will give a deaf ear to the voice of their cry, and ſhut the door of his grace on them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. This alſo conſiſts in an immunity from the ſins of the times, not only a ſympathy of their ſufferings, but a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from their ſins and defilements. When a Chriſtian ſaves himſelf from a perverſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is unſpotted with the times, keeps his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fair, though he lives in a contagious Air, yet preſerves himſelf free from its infection; and like the fiſh keeps the freſhneſs of his grace, though ſwimming in the ſalt-waters of ſin and wickedneſs. When out of an holy and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fear he dares not comply with, but withſtands, oppoſes, proteſts, witneſſes againſt, and mourns for the abominations of the times. This was <hi>Noabs</hi> carriage, being warned of God, and moved with an holy fear of his threatned Judgements, he makes an Ark, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. which the prophane and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure world flouted and derided. This was <hi>Lots</hi> ſecurity in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom,</hi> his ſoul was vexed with their filthy converſation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. And the Apoſtle makes him a preſident, his deliverance a ruling caſe, ſo as to argue and draw up a firm concluſion from it for all the godly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like circumſtances, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. This tenderneſs of conſcience was that which removed <hi>Joſiah</hi> out of the dint of ſuffering, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19.— Jealouſie of ſinning, is the beſt ſecurity againſt ſuffering. Such
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62588:137"/>as fear Gods Name, ſhall have the bright ſide of the cloud, when others have the dark; he will be to them a Sun, when to the reſt a fire. This holy carriage protected <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and kept him out of captivity; and exempted <hi>Baruch,</hi> and gave him his life for a prey. Gods mourners, who gave him their teſtimony, by wearing his livery, ſhall alſo have his mark of diſtinguiſhing favour, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. They are pluckt as brands out of the fire. We may invert that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and make the ſubject the predicate, <hi>cap.</hi> 7.16. They who are as Doves of the Valleys mourning for their iniquity, ſhall eſcape. They who feared the Lord, and thought on his Name (minded Religion, and made it their buſineſs) had a book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance written, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Phinehas</hi>'s zeal procures him the covenant of Gods peace, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A fiducial recumbency. God ſaves them that truſt in him, and becauſe they truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>ult.</hi> He that believes ſhall never be confounded. God is a buckler to them that truſt in him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.8. The ſcope of the whole 91 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is to aſſure preſervation to them that exerciſe faith in God, and keep <hi>in viis,</hi> in waies of ſtrict and cloſe walking with him: Not an abſolute faith, that God certainly will protect and deliver (for that cannot be without a ſpecial revelation) but a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt faith, and firm dependance on God, and his power and providence, both as able and willing to do it. <hi>Jobs</hi> confidence in God gave him aſſurance of his being his ſalvation. This obtained a ſpecial priviledge for <hi>Obedmelech, Jer.</hi> 39. <hi>ult. Thy life ſhall be for a prey to thee, becauſe thou haſt put thy truſt in me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And this gave <hi>Daniel</hi> a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62588:138"/>marvelous, yea miraculous protection, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22, 23. Innocency was found in him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A praying importunity. When Gods Spirit is poured out from on high, and his ſtir up themſelves to take hold on God, plead and wraſtle, call and cry, being his remembrancers day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. And ſo <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Seek the Lord all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his Judgement, ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs: it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> in the moſt deſolating Judgements God reſerves a remnant, and they are the ſeeking, praying ones, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be delivered.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A perfect and exact integrity. He ſaves the upright in heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.10. He compaſſeth them about with favour as a ſhield. <hi>The way of the juſt is uprightneſs: thou moſt upright doeſt weigh the path of the Juſt,</hi> Iſa. 26.7. Integrity is the ground of hope. This gave <hi>Job</hi> a certainty of his coming out of affliction, and of a glorious reſtauration, <hi>Job</hi> 13.18. <hi>I have ordered my cauſe, I know I ſhall be juſtified.</hi> This was that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pleaded under Gods correction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> under his enemies rage and oppoſition: <hi>Think upon me my God for good.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs is only plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the bar of Gods Juſtice, but our own in the Court of his mercy. A man may as well rear a building on a quagmire, or quick-ſand, as build a juſt hope on Hypocriſie; but righteouſneſs is a ſure ſoundation. The morning ſtar being once up and viſible, it's never very dark: Such as walk alwaies in the view of their uprightneſs, have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62588:138"/>alwaies ſome glimmerings of comfort, and are never hopeleſs and deſolate. This was Gods own aſſignation of the reaſon of <hi>Noahs</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Thee only have I found righteous in this generation.</hi> He that walks uprightly, walks ſecurely. When men are upright to God, to men, exerciſe a conſcience void of offence in duties of the firſt and the ſecond Table; keep themſelves from their iniquities, and have reſpect to all Gods Commandments, and whatſoever comes on them, do not forget God and his Covenant, they are upon the faireſt ground of ſecurity. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> puts them into not a bare capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but at leaſt a probability of mercy, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>Hate the evil, ſeek good, and eſtabliſh Judgement in the gate, it may be the Lord God of Hoſts will be gracious to the remnant of Joſeph.</hi> Nay the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> goes further, and puts them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a certainty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.16. (When Hypocrites were bundled as thorns, or packt as brands into the devouring fire of Gods wrath) who ſhould abide now? <hi>He that walketh righteouſly— He ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munition of Rocks: bread ſhall be given him, his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall be ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, A reſolved ſingularity, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeal and magnanimity for God in the worſt of times, both as to doing and ſuffering. When Chriſtians ſhine with an eminent luſtre of piety, like ſtars in a dark night, with greater bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and burn with an holy zeal, as fire in froſty weather, alwaies hotteſt, are none ſuch of the times, and do not only keep themſelves untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſins they embrace, but ſe on the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62588:139"/>duties they oppoſe; reſolving with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that they and their houſe will ſerve the Lord, and with <hi>Daniel,</hi> that they will as formerly (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all prohibitions to the contrary) make their ſupplication to the God of Heaven: They will keep up private family duties, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick attendances, though all give them up; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe duties of Religion moſt zealouſly, ſtrenuouſly, and induſtriouſly, that are moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous, though moſt oppoſed and deſpiſed; dancing before the Lords Ark, though laughed to ſcorn by the <hi>Michaels</hi> of the world. Though Princes ſpeak againſt them, they will meditate and ſpeak of Gods ſtatutes. They will appear for God, when all appear againſt him; as did <hi>Elijah,</hi> whom God wonderfully ſecured; and <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he ſtood by miraculously; and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whoſe language was <hi>fiat juſtitia ruat Coelum,</hi> whom God ſignally protected at <hi>Worms,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, though he were the only butt his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holineſs then had to ſhoot at. When a man is reſolved to conſult duty, and not ſafety, to ſuffer before he ſins, to burn in a fiery furnace, before bow to a graven Image; and with an holy fortitude, to ſtand up for God againſt the ſins of the time and place, though he hath none to back him, though all the neighbourhood, Town, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be otherwiſe affected, (as it was with him as to <hi>Baals</hi> Altars, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Athenian</hi> worſhips) and is determined to venture all for God, and in his Cauſe, with a <hi>Caeſarem veho</hi> in his mouth, if I periſh, I periſh; and can confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently look danger, bonds, death in the face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing with <hi>Paul,</hi> for the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62588:139"/>be bound with this chain, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.20. As holy fear, ſo this invincible faith, and undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, is an evident token of ſalvation, and that from God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28. Whom in the world ſhould God help, if not them that help with him? or ſtand cloſe to, if not thoſe who ſtand faſt to him? diſtinguiſhing duty ſhall certainly be rewarded with diſtinguiſhing mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, At what ſpecial times may Gods People look for help in time of mens violence and oppreſſion? Let me reſolve that one queſtion (in caſe the cauſe of the People of God ſhould be brought to an extremity) and leave it with them as a fortification of their hopes and ſpirits. Now, though as it's impoſſible for us infallibly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the periods of Gods grace to ſinners, when abuſed, ſo the times and ſeaſons of his giving out mercy and ſalvation to his People, when wanted; (times being in his hand) yet ſo far as we have the Scripture for our guide, we may aſſign ſome particular and extraordinary caſes, wherein help is promiſed, and ſo may be juſtly expected.</p>
            <p>As Firſt, When Gods Cauſe lies a bleeding, and the general concern and intereſt of Religion is at ſtake. God is jealous for his great Name. Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> pleads when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell before their enemies in battel, <hi>cap.</hi> 7.9. And <hi>Jeremiah, cap.</hi> 14.9. <hi>We are called by thy Name, leave us not;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Do not abhor us for thy Names ſake, do not diſgrace the Throne of thy glory</hi>— When the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my houted Gods People, pointing with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at them, Theſe are the People of the Lord, he had pity for his holy Name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.21. When
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62588:140"/>the whole intereſt of Religion, and Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt go off at a blow, God will ſtep between the Axe and them. We have ſuch a memorable example of this, in Gods deliverance of the whole body of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Haman</hi>'s conſpiracy, as the defeatment thereof may be a ſtanding encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to his people in all ages.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When a cloud of reproach and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal is caſt upon his Peoples innocency and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and thereupon ariſeth an unjuſt oppreſſion of them. This was <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe; all along his Friends falſly accuſed him, but his God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgate him, and ſo <hi>Davids,</hi> as appears almoſt in every Pſalm, where he now appeals to God, and makes proteſts of his innocency; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.3. then prays for relief, <hi>Pſal</hi> 38. <hi>ult.</hi> and 71.11, 12. and 109.26. profeſſeth his hope in God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15. promiſeth himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6. So <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> cap. 20.11. and the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.8, 10. who promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſalvation, and propheſie their enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, upon their ſlanders and ſcandals caſt upon them. God will take part with his people, what is done to them he takes as done to himſelf, whether in way of kindneſs or abuſe. As they vindicate his Name and glory in the World, ſo will he theirs from all reproach put upon it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When there is a failure and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all humane help. This is the Pſalmiſts argument, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>ult.</hi> and the ground of his plea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.8. <hi>Let thy tender mercies ſpeedily prevent us, for we are brought very low</hi> — When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Iſraelites were intangled, the Wilderneſs had ſhut them in,</hi> God comes and cuts a paſſage
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:62588:140"/>for them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.3. God commonly helps his People at the loweſt; the taking the weakeſt part is to him no diſadvantage. When <hi>vain is the help of man,</hi> and the cauſe is concluded deſperate for want of an Advocate, then God is called in by our Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Help Lord, for the godly man ceaſeth, — Cum nemini obtrudi poteſt</hi> — Pſal. 116.6. <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me.</hi> When <hi>Sion</hi> is called an Outcaſt, and no man ſeeks after her, then God chooſeth to have mercy on her, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When the Enemies of Gods Truth and Cauſe blaſpheme his Name, and inſult and triumph over his people. <hi>Whom haſt thou reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Rabſhaketh?</hi> Iſa. 37.23. There's the ground of his appearance againſt him: The King of Heaven may pardon his Peoples rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but revilings are too ſaucy for ſubjects to give, or the infinite and eternal God to bear from a vile worm, a ſinfull and mortal creature. It's time for God to ariſe, when wicked men thus make void his Law, and ſo far uſurp upon his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Prerogative, as to offer a competition with him, who, he or they, ſhall be Lord Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller in the World. When the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> talked blaſphemouſly, <hi>that God was the God of the hills, and not of the valleys,</hi> therefore did he deliver them into <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s hand, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.28. God dare wraſtle or engage with them, though on diſadvantagious ground. This argument the Church uſeth for deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.10, and ſtrongly urgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.10, 11, 12.— and the cruelty and blaſphemy of the enemy may prevail with God ſometimes, when cannot the Prayers of his Saints and People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.6, 7, 8. God
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62588:141"/>will ſave the afflicted People, and bring down the high and proud looks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.27. It's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, when God aſſigns to his people the reaſon of the expulſion of the Nations, and the introduction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their room, he gives it thus, <hi>Not for your righteouſneſs but their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Deut. 9.5. when Saints holineſs cannot avail for mercy, ſinners iniquity may call for juſtice.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When the ſpirits of the Saints begin to deſpond and fail, and yet are carried out with ſerious humiliation for their ſin, and (recovering theſe fits and qualms) with out-goings of Faith and Prayer to Heaven. When Chriſt comes, there will ſcarce be Faith in the Earth: when the hearts of Gods people begin to ſwoon, he will contend no longer, leſt their ſpirits ſhould fail before him. When the wicked are fleſht and pufft up with vain hopes, God breaks their bones aſunder, and their horn in pieces: when Gods people are as dry bones he lifes and fleſhes them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. When the Queſtion is asked, <hi>By whom ſhall Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ariſe, for he is ſmall,</hi> the anſwer is, <hi>The Lord repented for this,</hi> Amos 7.2, 3. God will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt on the lot of the righteous, leſt he puts forth his hand to iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. God paſſes by his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when as tall Cedars, and beholds them when low and weak Shrubs; he delights in them when in an abject low condition, and ſhews them mercy. When the Locuſts do moſt over-run the <hi>Caſſians,</hi> then the <hi>Seleucidian</hi> Birds come and are their devourers and deſtroyers. God is willing his people ſometimes ſhould be brought to that paſs, that they know not whither to turn, that ſo they may know what their God can, and will
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62588:141"/>bring about for them. When Gods people are laid upon their backs, then is a fit time for him to take them up into his arms, and put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom. Eſpecially, when their uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hearts are humbled by their afflictions (though oft-times not ſo ſincerely, at leaſt not throughly) God will come in for their help, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.— Eſpecially where there is a ſpirit of true humiliation, Faith and Prayer, that conjunction is a ſure Prognoſtick of mercy, and ſign of deliverance, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. compared with <hi>cap.</hi> 13.1.— No ſooner <hi>Daniel</hi> begins his Prayer, but the Captivity makes its end. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.— I will goe to my place till they acknowledge</hi>—When they come to ſeeking, God ſoon comes to ſaving. God never puts his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hard on begging, or inclines them to asking, but he ſtands ready handed with, and fully bent and diſpoſed to mercy. When the Sea gets into the Ship, and <hi>Peter</hi> cryes out, Chriſt reacheth out his arm to ſave him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Let this be a ground of adherence and firm conjunction and cleaving to God at all times, always cleave to this God who is ſuch an help, with full purpoſe of heart. As <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he goes, and living where he lives. Let nothing ſeparate you from your God. Like the Spaniel, couch cloſe to your Maſter: It's good for you to draw near to God; loſe all rather than loſe him; part with all the World before him. Better God your Friend to ſtand by you, than all the World without him. God is faithfull to you, be you ſo to him, and though all elſe do, do not you forſake him. Forget your Kindred and Fathers houſe: love not father or mother, wiſe or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62588:142"/>houſe or land, but hate them, if coming in competition with him. Throw off your Father (as holy <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaid) though he hangs about your neck, and trample on your mother, though ſhe lay in the way, to go out unto him. Give not up the cauſe of God to Satan, or the common Enemy, becauſe ye meet with a little trouble. Though the Captain hath not preſent relief, he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the City, if in any hope or expectation of it, but hold out if poſſible; he knows not how nigh he is relief. Sacrifice not God's intereſt, help may come before you expect it. Chriſtians, on your firſt coming in, you gave your ſelves up to the Lord, and indeed as that Noble perſon ſaid, In under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking Religion you might be deceived, if you thought to ſave any thing but your Souls. Oh take heed of making a breach of promiſe. Take heed of uſing any ſiniſter courſe, any unlawfull and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means, to evade the ſufferings of the Goſpel never accept a deliverance which is worſe than bondage, better have help Gods way than your own, as finding it, than as making it. Infinitely farr better that trouble which ends in peace, than that peace which ends in trouble. Fight therefore the good fight of Faith, ſo as at laſt ye may lay hold on the Crown of eternal life. So run as ye may obtair. Go on ſecurely and couragiouſly in the way of your duty whatſoever occurres, fear the Lord only, and keep his way. <hi>Eſther,</hi> though under ſtrict interdiction, yet ventures to approach the King, having faſted and prayed with her May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, in hope of divine benediction: The Apoſtles though under a prohibition (if not a ſuſpenſion) to preach chuſe to obey God before man, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. Be neither drawn or courted by the fawning
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62588:142"/>allurements of the world, nor yet frighted by it's terrours, to give up, or in, in your profeſſion. Take our Saviours advice, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Fear not him that can only kill the body, but rather him that can deſtroy both body and ſoul in Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, A word to ſinners, and ſtrangers from God and his hope and help concludes all. This offers firſt a word of direction to poor ſinners, whether they muſt go for help: They are all lapſed fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, plunged into a ſtate of guilt and corruption, brought under the ſupremacy and dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and have no power or ſufficiency of themſelves to recover, but God alone is their help, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help to be found.</hi> Man fell by his own free will, but cannot recover without Gods free grace, <hi>Homo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem quam accepit niſi Chriſto liberante non reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;</hi> as Saints therefore muſt bleſs him, ſo ſinners go to him as their only help; go to him for light, life, by Prayer, in the uſe of Ordinances, which are <hi>media cultus,</hi> and <hi>gratiae</hi> too; and though God will not hear you as ſinners, he may as creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour all to get an intereſt in God, that he may be your help. Time may, nay, will come, when you will ſtand in need of an help. You may have many ſtorms in your journey to eternity. It's good in a Sun-ſhine to provide for a ſtorm. A day of affliction may come, of death and diſſolution muſt come. A ſword, a plague, a fire, a famine, a captivity may come, and what will ye do in the evil day? All worldly helps will then be in vain; ye may kindle a fire of your own ſparks, but the end will be to lye down in ſorrow. You may with him that took up an hand-full of Gloworms in a dark
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62588:143"/>night, hope to warm your fingers with them, but it will be a falſe fire, and afford no heat with its light. Theſe Gloworms may ſhine till you come to the light of Sun or Candle. Theſe fair-fac'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things may pleaſe till you come to be convinced of a better beauty, but then will vaniſh. What will it profit to have a little comfort from them for a moment, and at laſt be caſt into the helliſh dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon? Though ye have all creatures for you, and God againſt you, your caſe is as ſad and miſerable, as had you God for you, and all the world againſt you, it were comfortable. Time may come too, that you may have all the world againſt you, and the Devil too, yea, your own conſciences, and what will ye do, if ye have not a God, a Chriſt to ſtand for you? Created-comforts cannot help you, if God hath once forſaken you; though he can ſupply their abſence, who is the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and make day, though there be not the ſtar of any creature viſible, yet they cannot his. If the Sun be gone down, it's night for all the ſtars. They have no Oyl for themſelves, much leſs can afford to others. There is no truſt in riches, friends, men, Angels; they are all a vain hope. The Parent may leave his Child, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Wife, the friend his friend, when time of trial comes. God hath ſtood on Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and blaſted all carnal confidence, as well as on Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> and bleſſed confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Yea, he may juſtly give us up to our own truſt, and thoſe things we have confided in, if we repoſe in any thing ſhort of himſelf, ſo he did them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.28. And will the creatures Mantle be a ſufficient covering to us? Will the great Tree of outward mercies, profeſſion, priviledges, protect
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62588:143"/>us under the ſoaking and laſting ſtorm of Gods wrath? The whole 49 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a conviction of the vanity of all the Pageantry of this world. They are as birds, or a ſtring that at one time or other will deceive us. And is not God in the mean time, a neceſſary, free, univerſal, ſole, ſufficient help? Who ever truſted in the world, and was not deceived? and who ever truſted in God, and was diſappointed? The ends of the earth look to him and are ſaved — O ceaſe then from theſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, and endeavour to make God your God, that ſo he may become your help. And if you would do ſo, labour firſt, to get an humble ſenſe of your own helpleſs and hopeleſs condition by nature. Bethink your ſelves, and ſee the plague of your own hearts. As long as the ſoul hath any crutch to lean on, it will never go alone; while it knows whither to run, it will never go to its God. O labour to be weary and heavy laden in your ſelves, and diſclaim all creature-dependance, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. Renounce all for Chriſt, and Gods free grace and mercy in him. And when in this wilderneſs, lean on the arm of your Beloved. Secondly, Fly to Gods Name and Covenant by faith in Chriſt. If ever God be yours, it muſt be through Chriſt. For there is no other Name; God hath laid help on his almighty arm, you muſt lay your hope there: All Gods help runs through Chriſt: he hath determined never to pardon one guilt, or give out one dram of grace, but through his blood. He is the only daismen, the true <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> by whoſe ſtrength, the heavy weights of ſin and wrath may be removed your ſouls. All the ſouls freſh ſprings are in him: He is the well head of ſalvation. Without union, no intereſt or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62588:144"/>No flying or abiding Gods preſence, eſcape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or enduring his wrath, unleſs your ſouls get under the skirt of his love. He that would have intereſt in God by any other proxy, muſt expect ſalvation by a deputy only. O come to him then by faith, venture on him as the Lepers did on the Camp, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7<hi>s.</hi> Do not only take Ropes about your necks, and put Sackcloth about your loyns, but come before this King of Heaven, he is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful King— And thirdly and laſtly, Strike Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, enter into a confederacy with him. Kings keep thoſe confederate, and in league with them. The wickeds is a vain, a ſtrumpets confidence, that challenge God as their Father and Husband, and yet wantonize from him, and care not for his company and communion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4. A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience only is the ground of a good hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ndence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. God may help and ſave by the wicked, but never will he be the Saviour of them. Break off from ſin then by righteouſneſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, yea, keep covenant with God. There's a league both offenſive and defenſive between God and his People, and the Promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (obſerving the conditions) ſtands good to all his faithful children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. If we walk before God, and be perfect, he will be our ſhield, and our exceeding great reward. To conclude all with the Apoſtles options, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>— And 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and eſtabliſh you in every good word and work.</hi>
